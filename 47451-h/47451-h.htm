<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>
<p>This story is complete in itself, but forms
the fourth in a line known under the general title
of &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have said before, this series was started
at the request of numerous boys and girls who
had read some volumes of my &ldquo;Rover Boys Series,&rdquo;
and who wanted to know what had taken
place at Putnam Hall Military Academy previous
to the arrival there of the three Rover brothers.</p>
<p>In the first volume of this series, called &ldquo;The
Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo; I related how Captain Putnam
came to found the institution and also told
of the doings of Jack Ruddy, Pepper Ditmore
and their chums. The young cadets were whole-souled
and full of fun, and enjoyed themselves
to the utmost.</p>
<p>In the second volume, entitled &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Rivals,&rdquo; more of the doings of the cadets
were chronicled, and the particulars were given
of a queer balloon ride, and of an odd discovery
in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The third volume, &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Champions,&rdquo;
brought Jack and Pepper once again to the
front, in a series of stirring athletic contests.
They had some bitter rivals, and one of these
played Jack a most foul trick, which came close
to having a serious ending.</p>
<p>Ever since the opening of the school the scholars
had had much trouble with an overbearing
teacher named Josiah Crabtree. When the Hall
was left in charge of Crabtree and a new instructor
named Cuddle, matters rapidly grew worse,
until there seemed nothing for the lads to do but
to rebel. How this was done, and what the rebellion
led to, I leave for the pages which follow
to relate.</p>
<p>Once more I thank my young friends for the
interest they have shown in my books. May this
tale please you in every way.</p>
<p><span class="center">Affectionately and sincerely yours,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Arthur M. Winfield</span>.</span></p>

<h1 title=""><span class="small">THE PUTNAM HALL REBELLION</span></h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">OUT ON THE CAMPUS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, we are to have target practice to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Pepper Ditmore. &ldquo;That suits
me exactly. Just wait, Jack, and see me make
half a dozen bull&rsquo;s-eyes, handrunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you make it a dozen, Pep, while
you are at it?&rdquo; answered Major Jack Ruddy, with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Pep makes one bull&rsquo;s-eye he will be lucky,&rdquo;
came from another of the cadets gathered on the
Putnam Hall campus. &ldquo;The last time we had
practice, instead of hitting the target he almost
killed a cow in the next field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Andy Snow!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I shot
straight enough, but the wind blew so hard it sent
the bullet the wrong way. Now if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity the wind didn&rsquo;t shift the target
to meet the bullet,&rdquo; cried Paul Singleton. &ldquo;Now
when I shoot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fat to shoot, Stuffer,&rdquo; interrupted
a youth who spoke with a strong Irish accent.
&ldquo;Sure, if you had to crawl up on the inimy, like
in war, you&rsquo;d tip over on your nose!&rdquo; And at
this sally from Joseph Hogan a laugh arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be fat than skinny,&rdquo; retorted Paul,
whose waist measurement exceeded that of any
other cadet of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we to do the practicing?&rdquo; asked
another boy, who was somewhat of a newcomer,
having been a pupil at the Military Academy for
less than a term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand we are to go to Rawling&rsquo;s pasture,
Fred,&rdquo; answered Jack Ruddy. &ldquo;Captain
Putnam is going to make the test a very thorough
one, too, for he says all of the students here ought
to be first-class marksmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d certainly like to know how to handle
a rifle,&rdquo; answered Fred Century. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used
a shotgun, in the woods, but never a rifle. I&rsquo;m
afraid I&rsquo;ll make a rather poor showing at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of the fellows will,&rdquo; returned the young
major. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t given to everybody to become
a good shot, no matter how hard a fellow tries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the others were talking, a big, broad-shouldered
youth joined the gathering. He was
Dale Blackmore, the captain of the Putnam Hall
football team, and a general leader in all kinds
of athletic sports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about the rifle practice, eh,&rdquo; said
Dale. &ldquo;I just heard the other fellows talking of
it, too. One of &rsquo;em said he was going to show
your crowd how to shoot,&rdquo; and he nodded toward
Jack Ruddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; questioned the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that bully makes me tired!&rdquo; cried Pepper
Ditmore. &ldquo;Every time anything is going on he
tries to push himself to the front&mdash;and nobody
wants him&mdash;at least I don&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; came from Andy Snow and Paul Singleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I doubt if he&rsquo;s any better shot nor
Major Jack,&rdquo; remarked Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as good, Emerald,&rdquo; interposed Pepper
quickly. &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s a soldier through and
through. If he wasn&rsquo;t the fellows wouldn&rsquo;t have
elected him major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Reff Ritter is a good marksman,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;He has made some fair scores and
he may have been practicing up for this contest.
Who was he talking to, Dale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his usual crowd of hangers-on, Gus Coulter,
Nick Paxton, Billy Sabine, and that bunch.
Coulter thinks, too, that he can make a big
score.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bank on Jack&mdash;and on Bart Conners,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;Bart is a good shot and
always was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, here comes Reff Ritter now,&rdquo; whispered
Andy, as a youth with a somewhat sour-looking
countenance put in an appearance. &ldquo;Gus Coulter
is with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Reff!&rdquo; sang out one of the boys, Dave
Kearney by name. &ldquo;I hear you are going to wax
us all at target practice to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; demanded Reff Ritter, coming
to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Reff and I are going to make star records,&rdquo;
came from Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you think you can shoot better than
Major Ruddy and Captain Conners?&rdquo; questioned
Andy Snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; came from Reff Ritter promptly.
&ldquo;When it comes to handling a rifle I don&rsquo;t take
a back seat for anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been practicing a tremendous lot
lately,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what I&rsquo;ve been doing,&rdquo; growled
Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to bet anybody here a
new hat that I come out ahead to-morrow.&rdquo; And
he gazed around with a &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t dare to take
me up&rdquo; look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take that bet,&rdquo; answered Pepper dryly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
&ldquo;Only a new hat would do me no good&mdash;since I
have to wear the regulation cap here. Just the
same, Reff, my boy, you won&rsquo;t come out ahead
of Jack and Bart, and I know it&mdash;and neither
will you, Gus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! just wait and see,&rdquo; grumbled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows think that because you have won
a few races and things like that you can win
everything,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter, sourly. &ldquo;Well, to-morrow
you&rsquo;ll find out differently. After the
shooting is over you&rsquo;ll see where I and Gus and
Nick Paxton stand.&rdquo; And with this remark he
strutted off, arm in arm with Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, but he is in a bad humor,&rdquo; observed
Andy Snow. &ldquo;Somebody must have brushed his
fur the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been behind in his lessons for over
a week,&rdquo; answered a boy named Joe Nelson, a
quiet and studious lad. &ldquo;Yesterday Captain Putnam
called him into the office for a talk. When
Reff came out he looked pretty glum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have gotten a strong lecture,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;And lectures don&rsquo;t agree with such fellows
as Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they agree with you, Pep?&rdquo; asked the
young major of the school battalion, with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Not much! I&rsquo;d rather write a composition
in Latin than face the captain for a lecture!
But, just the same, you can be sure Ritter didn&rsquo;t
get it harder than he deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like blowing one&rsquo;s own
horn,&rdquo; observed Fred Century. &ldquo;And certainly
Reff Ritter knows how to do that to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for drill, boys!&rdquo; cried Jack Ruddy, as a
bell rang out. &ldquo;Now, do your best on the parade
ground, even if you don&rsquo;t know how to hit the
target.&rdquo; And off he ran to get ready to assume
command of the Putnam Hall battalion.</p>
<p>The bell had hardly ceased to ring when there
followed the rolling of a drum, and out on the
school campus poured the students, in their neat
military uniforms, and with their guns and swords
polished to the highest degree. Major Jack Ruddy
was at the head of the battalion, which consisted
of Companies A and B, under the commands
of Bart Conners and a youth named Henry
Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion attention!&rdquo; commanded Major Jack,
after the rattle of the drum had ceased. &ldquo;Shoulder
arms! Forward, march!&rdquo; And then the
drums beat, the fifes struck up a lively air, and
the cadets began a march around the school
grounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>To those who have read the previous volumes
of this &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series,&rdquo; the lads mentioned
above will need no special introduction. For the
benefit of others let me state that Putnam Hall
Military Academy was a fine institution of learning,
located on the shore of Cayuga Lake, in New
York State. It was owned by Captain Victor
Putnam, a retired army officer, who, in days
gone by, had seen strenuous military service in the
far West. It was modeled somewhat after West
Point, our great national school for soldiery, but,
of course, on far less pretentious proportions. The
school building proper, located not far from the
lake, was of brick and stone, and contained many
classrooms, a big mess hall, a business office, library
and sitting room, and, on the upper floors,
many dormitories. Besides this building there
were a gymnasium, a boathouse, a barn, and half
a dozen minor structures. The location was ideal,
exactly suited to such a school as Captain Putnam
had established.</p>
<p>Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were chums,
hailing from the western part of New York State.
Jack was a little the older of the two and was inclined
to be studious. Pepper was full of fun, and
on this account was often called The Imp, a nickname
that did not bother him in the least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>When Jack and Pepper first arrived at the
school, as related in the initial volume of this
series, called &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo; they
found that no regular military organization had
yet been effected. After some time spent in drilling
and studying, the cadets were permitted to
ballot for their own officers, with the result that
Jack became the major of the battalion, Henry
Lee captain of Company A, and Bart Conners
captain of Company B. Jack wanted Pepper to
try for an official position, but The Imp declined,
stating he thought he could have more fun as a
private.</p>
<p>At that time there was an overbearing lad at
the school named Dan Baxter. He bribed Coulter
and some others to vote for him, but nevertheless
was defeated. Baxter was now away on a vacation,
and Jack and his chums wished he would
never come back.</p>
<p>It was not long before Jack and Pepper made
many friends, including Andy Snow, who was
an acrobatic youth, used to doing marvellous
&ldquo;stunts&rdquo; in the gymnasium; Dale Blackmore, of
football fame; Hogan, whose Irish wit was delightful
to listen to; Stuffer Singleton, who much
preferred eating to studying, and Joe Nelson, the
best scholar the Hall possessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>But if Jack and Pepper made many friends,
they also made many rivals and not a few enemies.
Baxter was gone, but Reff Ritter remained, and
what sort of a fellow he was we have already
seen. As Andy Snow said, Ritter frequently
imagined that he &ldquo;was the whole show.&rdquo; His particular
cronies were Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton,
while he had something of an admirer in a small
lad named Fenwick, usually known as &ldquo;Mumps,&rdquo;
who was a contemptible sneak, as had been proved
on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>The organizing of the school had been followed
by hard studying, yet not a few adventures had
fallen to the lot of Major Jack and Pepper, and
some of their chums. In the middle of one of the
terms George Strong, the second assistant teacher,
disappeared. He was found a prisoner in a hut,
being kept there by two insane relatives, and to
rescue him proved no easy task.</p>
<p>The assistant teacher&rsquo;s ancestry dated back to
Revolutionary times, and he told the boys of a
treasure buried in that vicinity by some relatives.
How the treasure was unearthed had been told in
detail in &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rivals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>With the coming of summer, the attention of
the cadets was given largely to sports in the field
and on the water. Jack&rsquo;s uncle presented him
with a fine sloop, the <i>Alice</i>, and in this the young
major sailed several races, as related in the third
volume of this series, entitled &ldquo;The Putnam Hall
Champions.&rdquo; The cadets also held a great bicycle
race and a hill climbing contest, and they
likewise had a bowling match with the team of a
rival school, Pornell Academy. At that time Fred
Century was a student at Pornell, but he became
disgusted at the way his fellow students acted, and
at the treatment he received from Doctor Pornell,
and left that institution of learning and came to
Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>As the time went on Reff Ritter became more
and more jealous of Major Jack&rsquo;s popularity. A
contest in the gymnasium was arranged between
the two, and then Ritter, with a wickedness which
he was wise enough to keep to himself, dosed the
young major with some French headache powders,
putting the stuff in Jack&rsquo;s drinking water.
As a consequence, Jack, while on the flying rings,
became dizzy and then unconscious, and would
have hurt himself seriously had he not been
caught as he fell. He was put to bed and was
sick for some time. It was discovered that he
had been dosed, but, so far, the perpetrator of the
vile deed had managed to keep his identity a
secret. Jack and Pepper suspected Ritter, but not
being able to prove the rascal guilty, could do
nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">PEPPER PLAYS A JOKE</span></h2>
<p>As there were a great many students to take
part, it had been arranged that the whole of the
next day should be devoted to rifle practice. The
cadets were to march to Rawling&rsquo;s pasture directly
after breakfast, and each youth was to carry his
lunch with him, as well as his rifle and some
rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young gentlemen,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
when the quartermaster of the battalion had
distributed the cartridges. &ldquo;Kindly remember
that your cartridges have bullets in them. I want
no loading or firing without permission. A rifle,
thoughtlessly discharged, may do great harm, and
there will be no need of loading your guns until
you are called upon to fire at one of the targets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we&mdash;we all got to do the&mdash;the firing?&rdquo;
asked Fenwick, the school sneak, in a trembling
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager Mumps is afraid to shoot with bullets,&rdquo;
whispered Pepper to Andy Snow. &ldquo;He
always handles his gun as if he was afraid it
would go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as much of a coward as he is a sneak,&rdquo;
answered Andy. His face broke into a sudden
grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in on it quick,&rdquo; returned Pepper,
scenting fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a pack of firecrackers, left over from
last Fourth of July&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, how could you keep them all this time?&rdquo;
cried The Imp, reproachfully. &ldquo;Why, a pack of
firecrackers means dead loads of fun. Let me
have them, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the whole pack? Not much! I want
some fun myself, sometime. I&rsquo;ll let you have a
dozen crackers, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make them do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to play a trick on Mumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, keep your eye peeled for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>This talk took place half an hour before the
boys were to start away from the school. Having
procured the firecrackers, Pepper sought out
the school sneak and found him talking to Billy
Sabine, a cadet who was at times a sneak and then
again quite a good fellow. Mumps had his gun
over his shoulder and Sabine had his firearms
across his elbow. Without being observed, The
Imp lit the long stems of two firecrackers and
dropped one down the barrel of each weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, you fellows!&rdquo; he cried, hurriedly.
&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked both of the others, while
a small crowd began to collect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has sticks of dynamite, and some
of the stuff was put in some of the guns,&rdquo; went
on Pepper innocently. &ldquo;You want to look out, or
your gun may explode and blow you to bits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me, is that possible!&rdquo; ejaculated
Mumps, and turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Sabine, and then
glanced at the muzzle of his weapon. &ldquo;I declare,
what makes that smoke? And look, your gun is
smoking, too!&rdquo; he added, to Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dynamite&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pepper, and
backed away as if in terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, do you really think so?&rdquo; quaked
Mumps. &ldquo;If I thought&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bang! went one of the firecrackers, and both
Mumps and Sabine let out yells of fear. Bang!
went the second cracker, and now both cadets
threw their guns from them and ran toward the
school building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dynamite! We&rsquo;ll be blown to pieces!&rdquo;
screamed Mumps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody wants to kill us!&rdquo; roared Sabine,
and put his hands to his ears, as if to keep out
the sounds of some awful explosion.</p>
<p>And then both boys disappeared around a corner
of the Hall. As they did this The Imp rushed
forward, cleaned the guns of the exploded firecrackers,
and threw the burning bits of cracker
paper in some bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a joke!&rdquo; cried Andy, who has witnessed
the scene, and he and a number of others
laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be afraid to touch the guns after this,&rdquo;
was Emerald&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Sure, they&rsquo;ll think the
old Nick is after bein&rsquo; in &rsquo;em, so they will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come back!&rdquo; called out Dave Kearney.
&ldquo;And look, they&rsquo;ve got old Crabtree with
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Crabtree is coming I think I&rsquo;ll dust out!&rdquo;
murmured Pepper, and lost no time in disappearing.</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree was the first assistant teacher,
and he was as cordially hated by the majority of
the cadets as George Strong, the second assistant,
was beloved. Crabtree was a fine scholar,
but he was headstrong and sarcastic, and continually
&ldquo;picking&rdquo; at those under him, no matter
how hard they studied or how well they behaved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is this I hear about dynamite?&rdquo; he demanded,
as he strode up and glared at the assembled
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite?&rdquo; asked Andy innocently. &ldquo;Did you
say dynamite, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. There was an explosion out here.
These boys&rsquo; guns&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, these guns are all right,&rdquo; said Dale
Blackmore, picking them up. &ldquo;I guess Fenwick
and Sabine got scared at nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly did,&rdquo; added Andy, and then,
getting behind the teacher, he doubled up his fist
and shook it threateningly at Mumps and Billy.</p>
<p>Now, if there was one thing both the younger
cadets feared it was a whipping, and this suggestive
attitude of Andy made each of them quail.
They both realized that if they told on Pepper
they would be punished for it. Each took his
gun rather sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenwick, what have you to say?&rdquo; began Josiah
Crabtree. Just then the welcome rattle of the
drum was heard, calling the battalion to get ready
for the march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess it was a&mdash;a mistake,&rdquo; faltered the
sneak. &ldquo;Can I go and get in line, please sir?&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I suppose so&mdash;since this is no time
to investigate,&rdquo; answered Josiah Crabtree; and
off ran Mumps and Sabine, and the others also
departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did Crabtree say?&rdquo; asked Pepper
of Andy, when he got the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t have time to say much&mdash;the drum call
broke in on his investigation. I hope, for your
sake, Pep, he doesn&rsquo;t take it up when we get back,&rdquo;
added the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day for the outing, and the
cadets certainly presented an inspiring sight as
they marched from the campus and turned into
the country road leading to the pasture where
the rifle practice was to be held. Captain Putnam
was on horseback, along with George Strong
and an old army officer named Pallott, who was to
assist in showing the boys how to hold their
rifles while shooting and how best to take aim.
Behind this little cavalcade came Major Jack with
his sword flashing brightly, and followed by Company
A and Company B. To the front were the
two drummers and two fifers, making the welkin
ring with their martial music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you look fine, so you do!&rdquo; sang out an old
farmer, as he drew up by the roadside with his
wagon to let them pass. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a credit to this
section. If I had the money I&rsquo;d send my son
Jock to train with you, yes, I would!&rdquo; And he
waved a grimy hand after them.</p>
<p>A little later the cadets heard the honk honk
of an automobile horn and soon a big touring car
came into sight. It contained Roy Bock, Bat
Sedley and several other students from Pornell
Academy. As soon as Bock saw the young soldiers
he stopped his machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, look at the tin soldiers!&rdquo; he sang out.
&ldquo;Going to hunt mosquitoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are going to hunt somebody who
knows how to bowl,&rdquo; retorted Pepper, who was
near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! We can bowl right enough and don&rsquo;t
you forget it,&rdquo; growled Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you can&rsquo;t beat Putnam Hall,&rdquo; retorted
Dale; and then the cadets passed on, leaving
the bully of the rival school in anything but
a happy frame of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those tin soldiers make me sick,&rdquo; said one
of the students in the touring car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get square with them for taking
our trophies away,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did that because we stole their cannon
and flagstaff,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Fred Century can train with
them,&rdquo; added a youth named Carey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll square it up with them some day,&rdquo; came
from Roy Bock. &ldquo;Just wait till I think of something
good. I&rsquo;ve got it in for Jack Ruddy, Pepper
Ditmore and that crowd, and don&rsquo;t you forget
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; cried another boy. &ldquo;The whole
crowd is away from the school to-day. Why
can&rsquo;t we visit the place on the sly and turn things
topsy-turvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must be left behind,&rdquo; answered
Will Carey, who was far from brave, as my old
readers know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;we can keep out of the
servants&rsquo; way&mdash;or get them out of ours,&rdquo;
answered Roy Bock. His crafty face became
fixed for a moment. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea. Let
us visit Putnam Hall by all means and fix things
up! When those tin soldiers get back they won&rsquo;t
know what to make of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t want to get caught at this,&rdquo;
said Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; demanded Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;buts&rsquo; about it,&rdquo; said a youth named
Grimes, who hated Major Jack and his chums
greatly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for visiting Putnam Hall to-day.
We couldn&rsquo;t have a better chance, with the captain
and his cadets away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The touring car journeyed along slowly and the
students from Pornell Academy talked the matter
over carefully. Just as they came in sight of the
Hall they saw a buggy drive away from the entrance
and turn in the direction of Cedarville,
the nearest village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the head teacher, a fellow named
Crabtree,&rdquo; said Bock. &ldquo;The fellow driving him is
Peleg Snuggers, the general helper. Boys, outside
of some help that doesn&rsquo;t count, the coast is
clear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a scheme,&rdquo; said Grimes. &ldquo;Let us hide
the auto in the woods, and then disguise ourselves
as tramps by rubbing dust on our faces and
putting on the old auto dusters. Then we can
sneak up to the school building and the gym., and
learn how the land lays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and turn things inside out,&rdquo; answered
Roy Bock, with a gloating look. &ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t they
be surprised when they get back to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The suggestion to hide the touring car and
disguise themselves was quickly put into execution,
and then, with great caution, the six students
from Pornell Academy leaped a side hedge and
made for the gymnasium. Here they spent nearly
half an hour in &ldquo;fixing things up&rdquo; to their satisfaction.
Then they entered the school building
by a side door, and while three went to the library
and classrooms the others ascended to the
dormitories. They took care to keep out of the
way of all the hired help, although to do so taxed
their ingenuity to the utmost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I reckon we have done something toward
squaring accounts,&rdquo; remarked Roy Bock, as
he led the way back to the touring car. &ldquo;Even
the servants won&rsquo;t be able to straighten things
out. When those folks get back they won&rsquo;t know
their own school!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">AT TARGET PRACTICE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are! Now to make nothing but
bull&rsquo;s-eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Pepper who spoke, as the Hall cadets
came to a halt in Rawling&rsquo;s pasture,&mdash;a lot containing
nearly a hundred acres which were almost
as smooth as a barn floor. It had taken the
battalion almost an hour to march there, and the
students were allowed half an hour in which to
rest up previous to beginning the contest on the
three ranges which had been established in the
pasture. The ranges were of one hundred yards,
two hundred yards, and three hundred yards, the
last named distance being deemed sufficiently
great for the light rifles the cadets used. Had
they had arms of greater caliber, Captain Putnam
would have made the long range five hundred
yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to make very much of a score,&rdquo;
said Andy Snow. &ldquo;I am not much of a shooter.
Now if it was a contest in the gym.&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Andy would win all the medals,&rdquo; finished
Jack, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a fishing contest,&rdquo; put in Stuffer,
who loved to go out with his rod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and what&rsquo;s the matter wid an eating
contest, Stuffer?&rdquo; inquired Hogan, with a broad
grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m after thinking you&rsquo;d take the head
prize there&mdash;and all the others, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, you needn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; grumbled Stuffer.
&ldquo;I notice you can do your share when we sit down
in the mess hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing I like about Putnam Hall,&rdquo;
declared Fred Century. &ldquo;A fellow always gets
enough to eat&mdash;at least I do. Now at Pornell
Academy the meals were very uneven. The dinners
were usually good, but some of the suppers
were woefully slim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the meals were slim here I&rsquo;d rebel,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I!&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d raise the
biggest kick you ever heard of.&rdquo; How true their
words were to become we shall see later.</p>
<p>The shooting soon began&mdash;at a distance of one
hundred yards, and for two hours there was a
steady crack! crack! of the rifles.</p>
<p>Each cadet had three shots at each target. A
bull&rsquo;s-eye counted five, so a perfect score would
total up to forty-five.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>On the short range, Jack managed to make
three bull&rsquo;s-eyes, thus scoring 15. Pepper got 13
and Andy 11. Much to his own delight Reff
Ritter got 15, although one of his shots barely
touched the bull&rsquo;s-eye. Coulter received but 9,
much to his disgust. The other cadets ranged
from 10 to 5,&mdash;the five being made by Mumps,
who was almost afraid to discharge his weapon.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="ON THE SHORT RANGE, JACK MANAGED TO MAKE THREE BULL&rsquo;S-EYES." width="500" height="764" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">ON THE SHORT RANGE, JACK MANAGED TO MAKE THREE BULL&rsquo;S-EYES.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t Mumps make a fine soldier!&rdquo; whispered
Pepper to Jack. &ldquo;If he saw the enemy approaching
he&rsquo;d run for all he was worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t get too frightened to move,&rdquo;
added the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is both a coward and a sneak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the two-hundred yard range Jack made 14,
while Pepper finished with 13, the same as before.
The long-range shooting was not to take
place until after lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to call it my unlucky
thirteen or not,&rdquo; said The Imp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so good
as your score, but it&rsquo;s better than some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly lucky,&rdquo; answered Andy, who
had made but 9 on the middle range. &ldquo;If you do
so well on the long range you&rsquo;ll be one of the
leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter made 14,&rdquo; put in Joe Nelson.
&ldquo;He and Jack and Bart Conners are tied for first
place so far.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter had dropped behind, and Paxton&rsquo;s
score isn&rsquo;t much better than Mump&rsquo;s,&rdquo; came from
Dale Blackmore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two elevens,&rdquo; said Fred Century. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s so bad for a fellow who hasn&rsquo;t
used a rifle for some years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lunch was had in the shade of a number of
trees growing at the edge of the pasture. While
the cadets were eating many of them stacked their
rifles and hung their belts and cartridge boxes on
the weapons. Jack put aside his sword and also
the gun and cartridge holder he had been using.
There was a small brook nearby, fed by springs,
and in this many of the boys washed their hands
and faces before eating.</p>
<p>While the meal was still in progress Gus Coulter
motioned to Reff Ritter and Nick Paxton, and
the three drew away from the crowd and into
some bushes behind the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; said Coulter, in a low voice.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if we can work it or not, but if we
can&mdash;well, somebody will be surprised, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo; demanded Ritter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was hanging around when Bob Grenwood,
the quartermaster, was giving out the ammunition
for the shooting after lunch, on the three-hundred
yard range. I heard him say that he had
brought along a case of blanks by mistake. He
said they looked a good deal like the cartridges
that had bullets in. Now if we could get hold
of that case of blanks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do that easily enough,&rdquo; interrupted
Nick Paxton. &ldquo;The case is right over yonder,
on a rock.&rdquo; And he pointed with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Reff
Ritter, a wise look coming into his face. &ldquo;You
mean for us to get the blanks and substitute them
for the regular cartridges some of the fellows intend
to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Can we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s a great scheme. I&rsquo;d
like to put it up Ruddy&rsquo;s back&mdash;and up Ditmore&rsquo;s
back, too.&rdquo; Ritter bit his lip in thought for a
moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can get hold of that
case of cartridges anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great care the plotters stole through the
bushes and up to the rock upon which rested the
case containing the blank cartridges. All of the
other cadets were busy lunching and nobody
noticed them as they hauled the box out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cover is loose, anyway,&rdquo; reported Ritter.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll take a few out, just for luck,&rdquo; and he
appropriated about a dozen blanks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take out the top layer,&rdquo; suggested Coulter.
&ldquo;Then Grenwood won&rsquo;t be so apt to notice that
the box has been trifled with.&rdquo; And he and Paxton
did so. Then the cover was slid into place
once more and the case was restored to its original
position. The blanks certainly looked like
full cartridges, being tipped with silvery paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to do some substituting,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hardest part of the job. Some
of the fellows are hanging around those cartridge
belts and boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get them to walk away,&rdquo; suggested
Coulter. &ldquo;Get them interested in something,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Ritter. &ldquo;Nick, you walk
down in the woods on the other side of the brook
and yell like mad. Say you saw a big snake, or
something. That will draw the crowd, and then
Gus and I can get in our work with the blank cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; answered Nick Paxton, and hurried
around through the bushes and across the
brook. He had been gone about five minutes
when the cadets at lunch, as well as Captain Putnam
and the others, heard a great yelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help! A snake! A snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed half a dozen, and
then, as the yelling was continued, a rush was
made in the direction of the brook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance,&rdquo; said Ritter to Coulter,
and then the pair stole out of the bushes and in the
direction of the stacked arms and the cartridge
belts and boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Paxton?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Putnam, who was the first to arrive at the
spot from whence the cries for help emanated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snake, sir!&rdquo; answered the cadet glibly.
&ldquo;Ugh! He ran right between my legs!&rdquo; And
Paxton pretended to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snake!&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you kill it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a snake, and&mdash;and I guess it was a rattler,
too. It was about that long,&rdquo; and Nick
Paxton held his hands as far apart as possible.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t kill it for I didn&rsquo;t have a thing in my
hand. I&mdash;er&mdash;I looked for a rock, but the snake
was too quick for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news that a snake was around&mdash;and that
it might be a rattlesnake at that&mdash;alarmed many
of the cadets, and some of them recrossed the
brook to the open pasture. But others, and Captain
Putnam, began a hunt for the reptile, but,
of course, without success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well give up the search,&rdquo; said the
master of the Hall, after a hunt of ten minutes.
&ldquo;If it was a rattlesnake it has managed to get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was you doing here, Paxton?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;er&mdash;I came over to look for&mdash;er&mdash;for
ferns,&rdquo; stammered the youth who had played
the trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferns? Didn&rsquo;t know you were interested in
ferns,&rdquo; observed Joe Nelson, who was something
of a collector of plants himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do a little collecting now and then,&rdquo;
answered Paxton, and then walked off, to escape
being questioned further.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the noonday rest came to
an end and the target practice was again taken
up. In the presence of his pupils Captain Putnam
took several shots at the long distance target,
making a bull&rsquo;s-eye each time. Then he and the
old army officer who had been hired showed the
boys how to fire to the best advantage.</p>
<p>Reff Ritter was one of the first to shoot at the
three hundred yard target, and much to his chagrin
got only three fours&mdash;a total of 12. Coulter
got but 9, and Paxton 7.</p>
<p>When Jack stepped to the front with the rifle
and cartridge box he had been using Reff Ritter
winked suggestively at Coulter and Paxton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see something rich!&rdquo; whispered
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! you want to keep this to yourself,&rdquo;
warned the bully of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, a bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; said Pepper to his
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right in the middle of the eye, too,&rdquo; added
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; answered the young major,
modestly.</p>
<p>With great care he took aim at the target and
pulled the trigger. There was a crack and a
flash and then a moment of breathless waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hit the target even!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement was true, and the young
major turned a trifle pale in spite of his efforts
to control himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire hastily, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam kindly. &ldquo;Draw a bead directly on
the center of the target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;thought I did,&rdquo; stammered Jack.</p>
<p>Again the rifle was raised. Jack was now a bit
nervous, yet he managed to steady himself ere he
took another shot. His aim was directly for the
center of the target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another miss!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack, what&rsquo;s got over you?&rdquo; cried Pepper,
real distress showing in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&ldquo; faltered the youthful major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel well?&rdquo; asked Stuffer. &ldquo;Or is it
your eyesight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel well enough&mdash;and my eyesight is
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you had a blank cartridge,&rdquo; cried Dale,
suddenly.</p>
<p>This remark caused Jack to look at the remaining
cartridges he possessed. Captain Putnam
insisted upon examining them also, for he,
too, was unwilling to believe that the young officer
has made a total miss of the two shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are certainly ball cartridges,&rdquo; he said,
as he looked them over. &ldquo;Nothing wrong there.
You must have been careless in your aim, Major
Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I did the very best I could,&rdquo;
pleaded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have one more shot,&rdquo; answered the
master of the school.</p>
<p>As pale as a sheet the young major of the battalion
walked to the front once more and raised
his rifle. For several seconds there was a deathlike
silence. Then came another crack and flash
and a moment of suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! A bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time you did it, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you do that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a long breath, Jack lowered his rifle and,
turning faced the master of the school:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam,&rdquo; he said in a low but firm
tone. &ldquo;I made a bull&rsquo;s-eye that time because there
was a bullet in the cartridge. I am satisfied now
that my other two shots were blanks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE BLANK CARTRIDGES</span></h2>
<p>For the moment after Jack spoke so positively
there was a silence. Captain Putnam looked at
the young officer thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that&rsquo;s all tommy-rot!&rdquo; observed Reff
Ritter. &ldquo;He missed and that is all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he missed,&rdquo; chimed in Coulter. &ldquo;He
isn&rsquo;t a crack shot by any means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so certain that the first two
shots were blanks, Major Ruddy?&rdquo; asked the
master of the school, somewhat sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I think my record helps to prove it,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;At the hundred-yard target I
made three bull&rsquo;s-eyes; at the two-hundred-yard
target I made two bull&rsquo;s-eyes and a four; now I
have made a bull&rsquo;s-eye and two blanks. Doesn&rsquo;t
it stand to reason, sir, that if those cartridges had
not been blanks I would at least have made a two
or a one?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable, yes,&rdquo; answered the captain,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;But I did not know any blanks
had been brought along, much less dealt out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought a case along by mistake,&rdquo; put in Bob
Grenwood. &ldquo;But as soon as I discovered my
mistake I put the case to one side. There it is,
sir, on yonder rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. You are sure you didn&rsquo;t hand any
blanks around? That particular box looks like
the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;I was very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Putnam strode over to the rock and
shoved back the lid of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the top layer of cartridges is gone!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Was the box full when you opened it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;I think so, sir,&rdquo; stammered
the quartermaster of the school battalion.
&ldquo;It looked full to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; went on Captain Putnam,
raising his voice. &ldquo;Please to look over the cartridges
you have left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hasty examination by over a score
of cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine are O. K., sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve got a blank!&rdquo; cried Andy Snow,
rushing forward and holding it up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of
the kind we used to have&mdash;those that looked so
much like the ball cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! So it is&mdash;one of the kind made to represent
ball cartridges,&rdquo; mused Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two of them!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper, and
held them up. &ldquo;My other one is all right,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two blanks and one good one,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;That must have been just what I had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quartermaster Grenwood, can you explain
this?&rdquo; demanded Captain Putnam, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, sir. I&mdash;I am sure I didn&rsquo;t deal out
any of the blanks. I was very careful, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you account for the blanks being
in use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t account for it, sir. I am sure,
though, I didn&rsquo;t give them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave out all the ammunition, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must have given out the blanks.
It was very careless on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder I missed!&rdquo; growled one of the
cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to shoot over again,&rdquo; added
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mean trick!&rdquo; cried a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quartermaster Grenwood, you have been
grossly careless, and your carelessness has caused
a great deal of trouble,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
sternly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t careless, I tell you, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence. I say you were careless, and I now
ask you to resign your position as quartermaster
of the school battalion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo; gasped Bob Grenwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I said. The battalion must have
a quartermaster who can be relied upon at all
times. Supposing we were going to have a sham
battle and you dealt out ball cartridges instead of
blanks, what would happen? Why some of the
cadets might be killed! Do you resign or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you refuse to resign I shall have to take
the office away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll resign,&rdquo; cried Bob Grenwood, bitterly.
&ldquo;All the same, I say you are treating me
unjustly.&rdquo; And with a red face and bowed head
he stepped back into the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Bob did it,&rdquo; whispered Stuffer
to Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and I thought he was more careful meself,&rdquo;
answered the Irish-American cadet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a bad mess, so it is!&rdquo; added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Captain Putnam now held a consultation with
several of the others and then announced that
for every shot fired which had not hit a target the
cadet should have another try. In the meantime
the blanks were collected and ball cartridges dealt
out instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, show &rsquo;em what you can do!&rdquo; cried
Pepper, as his chum walked to the front once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, I guess our plan is busted,&rdquo;
whispered Paxton to Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not a word of it!&rdquo; whispered the
bully, warningly. &ldquo;If Captain Putnam ever finds
it out,&mdash;well, he&rsquo;ll make it mighty warm for us,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great care Jack took aim once more.
Everybody watched him with interest, and a wild
shout went up when the result was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, what did I tell you?&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I
knew he could do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now another, Jack!&rdquo; said Andy, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>And the youthful major did make another
bull&rsquo;s-eye, amid the applause of his many friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the highest score yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, I must congratulate you,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam, holding out his hand. &ldquo;I am
now as convinced as you are that those other shots
were blanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, that&rsquo;s the highest score yet,&rdquo; said Dale.
&ldquo;I rather think you take the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know there was a prize, Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, metaphorically speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bested Reff Ritter and that&rsquo;s a good
deal,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>When Pepper came to shoot he made one
bull&rsquo;s-eye and two fours. This gave him quite a
high score and made him content. Andy and Dale
also did well, while Bart Conners tied Ritter.
Mumps and Paxton each made two misses on the
long distance target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More blanks, I suppose,&rdquo; grumbled Paxton,
although he knew better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;That was only
your carelessness did that. You shot too quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not feeling well to-day,&rdquo; said the
school sneak lamely. &ldquo;I ought to have stayed at
the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the target practice was at an end the
cadets were allowed an hour to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take a walk through the woods,&rdquo; said
Pepper. And he and Jack and half a dozen went
off in one direction while Reff Ritter and his cronies
went off in another. Bob Grenwood felt so
bad that he strolled off by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, I feel sorry for Bob,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Even if he did deal out the blanks, I don&rsquo;t think
he meant to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;He feels all cut up to lose the quartermastership,&rdquo;
said Dale. &ldquo;After the captain made him
resign I saw the tears standing in his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say if we go to Captain Putnam
and ask him to reinstate Grenwood?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper, who was always ready to help
anybody in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that willingly,&rdquo; came from several of
the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ought to go right away,&rdquo;
said Bart Conners. &ldquo;Wait a few days&mdash;until his
temper has a chance to cool. Finding the blanks
riled him all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, fellows, have you heard the
news?&rdquo; asked Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new teacher is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody. I heard Captain Putnam and Mr.
Strong talking about it. It seems Mr. Strong has
got to go away on business, and the new man is
coming during his absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, did you hear, Joe?&rdquo; asked several,
for they were always anxious concerning their
instructors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he isn&rsquo;t like old Crabtree,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;If he is I&rsquo;ll feel like jumping into
the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about him, excepting
that his name is Pluxton Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pluxton Cuddle!&rdquo; cried The Imp. &ldquo;Wonder
if he&rsquo;ll try to cuddle up to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear that he was quite a scientist,&rdquo; went
on Joe Nelson. &ldquo;One of the kind who does everything
by rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I can see my finish!&rdquo; sighed Pepper.
&ldquo;It will be ten minutes for this, ten minutes
for that, and so on, all day long. And find out
the whyforness of the thus of everything in the
bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry beforehand,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;He may be another Mr. Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, Jack! Mr. Strong is one teacher
out of a hundred, heaven bless him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If all teachers were like Mr. Strong, going to
boarding school would be a cinch,&rdquo; added Andy,
slangily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the dearest man who ever tried
to teach a fellow the value of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, and don&rsquo;t
you forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I firmly believe we learn twice as much
under a man like Mr. Strong as we do under old
Josiah Crabtree,&mdash;although Crabtree may be the
greater scholar,&rdquo; came from Stuffer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The cadets spent a pleasant time in the woods,
and at the roll of the drum hastened back to the
pasture. When the two companies were formed
it was found Bob Grenwood was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got disgusted and said he was going to
walk back to the Hall alone,&rdquo; said one of the
students. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I blame him much.
It was a terrible thing to be made to resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes more the line of march back
to Putnam Hall was taken up. To give the cadets
a variety of scene, Captain Putnam took to another
road than that pursued in the morning. This
was nearly a mile longer, and, consequently, it was
after the supper hour when the cadets came in
sight of the school buildings.</p>
<p>As the cadets marched up to the campus a man
came rushing out of the school holding up his
hands in horror. It was Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam! Captain Putnam!&rdquo; he
gasped. &ldquo;Come quickly! Something dreadful
has happened!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A &ldquo;ROUGH HOUSE&rdquo; AT PUTNAM HALL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo; demanded
the master of the school, as he dismounted
from his horse and strode forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The schoolrooms, sir&mdash;and the sitting room
and library! All turned topsy-turvy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! I just came in from the village&mdash;I
went on a little business, as you know. When I
got back I went to the library for a book&mdash;&lsquo;The
History of Turkey&rsquo;&mdash;and when I got there!&rdquo; Josiah
Crabtree held up his hands mutely. &ldquo;It is a
shame, an outrage, sir! And the classrooms are
about as bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about this,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam, and
strode into the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; said Pepper, after the
cadets had broken ranks. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it is!&rdquo;
And he ran off to place his weapon in the gun
rack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Something was indeed wrong, as a hasty glance
around the lower floor of the school building revealed.
Every book in the library had been
thrown on the floor, and to the general heap
were added several pictures and maps taken from
the walls. Two inkstands from a writing desk
had been overturned, one on a table and over a
beautiful statue of Justice standing on a pedestal
in a corner. The floor rug had been folded up
and thrown over a chandelier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo; demanded the master of the
school sternly. &ldquo;Who did this, I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody answered for the reason that nobody
knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the schoolrooms are as bad,&rdquo; cried Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;Never have <i>I</i> seen the equal, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without loss of time Captain Putnam walked
from one classroom to another and the cadets
and teachers followed him, and so did some of the
frightened servants. In every room books and
papers were scattered in all directions. On a big
school globe rested an old silk hat, and an old
linen duster that Josiah Crabtree occasionally
used in warm weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that! The rascals!&rdquo; spluttered the
irate teacher. &ldquo;My coat, sir! It makes the
globe look like a&mdash;a&mdash;scarecrow, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="&ldquo;IT LOOKS LIKE A SCARECROW, SIR!&rdquo;" width="500" height="769" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">&ldquo;IT LOOKS LIKE A SCARECROW, SIR!&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam,
and for an instant he felt inclined to laugh.
At the same time Pepper burst into a roar and
Andy and some others did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a rough house and no mistake,&rdquo; murmured
Jack. &ldquo;Who did it, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has been here during our absence,&rdquo;
said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, stop your laughing!&rdquo; exclaimed Josiah
Crabtree, turning suddenly upon Pepper and his
chums. &ldquo;If you do not stop this minute, I&rsquo;ll
punish you severely! This is no laughing matter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t laugh any more,&rdquo; answered Pepper,
and, behind the fussy teacher&rsquo;s back drew such
a doleful face that Andy and Dale were almost
convulsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a go!&rdquo; cried one of the cadets presently.
&ldquo;My Latin grammar is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is my history!&rdquo; came from another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hasty hunt was made and soon it was discovered
that every history and every Latin grammar
was missing. All the other books were there,
although mixed up and mussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind the loss of the grammar
and history so much,&rdquo; observed Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to get rid of them forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; sang out Andy softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; cried Captain Putnam loudly, and at
the call everybody became silent. &ldquo;If any one of
you know anything about this, I want that pupil
to step forward and say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Nobody budged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was anybody left behind when we went for
the target practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a pause. Nobody spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is, as Mr. Crabtree says, an outrage, and
I intend to get at the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know somebody who came back before we
did,&rdquo; said Mumps, stepping to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that, Fenwick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob Grenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a little sneak!&rdquo; murmured Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have his neck wrung!&rdquo; added
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! So he did,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;Does anybody know where Grenwood is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked from one to another of the assembled
scholars, but all shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, have Peleg Snuggers hunt Grenwood
up, and at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; answered the teacher and hurried
off to find the general utility man of the Hall.
Then both went in search of Bob Grenwood, but
failed to find the ex-quartermaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t come back after he left us,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;Maybe he felt too down-hearted to
return. I must say, I feel mighty sorry for Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to straighten out
the library, sitting room and classrooms, and then
the cadets went to supper. After that some of the
boys went out on the campus, some to the lake
shore, and others to the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing is certain, some of our school-books
are gone,&rdquo; said Joe Nelson. &ldquo;Too bad! I
had an essay in my history. If it is not found
I&rsquo;ll have to write another paper I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not do it!&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your
fault that the paper is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and his chums were entering the gymnasium
when a student who had gone ahead uttered
a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been here, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do? Did everything they could to spoil this
place,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>When lit up the gymnasium certainly presented
&ldquo;a sight for to see,&rdquo; as Andy expressed it.
The wooden horses had been stacked in a corner,
the rings and turning bars had been cut down, and
the Indian clubs, pulling machines, and the floor
covered with oil and grease. Jack did not notice
the grease on the floor until he slipped and fell,
and Pepper, who was at his side, came down on
top of him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, fellows, this place is almost ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows who did this ought to be tarred
and feathered!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he got up and rubbed
a bruised elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of our cadets would do
such a trick as this,&rdquo; observed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter and his cronies are mean enough
to do anything,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were with us,&rdquo; answered Bart
Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I think I know who is guilty!&rdquo; almost
shouted Jack, as a sudden idea popped into his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Bock and his crowd&mdash;the fellows we met
this morning in the big touring car&mdash;the chaps
who called us tin soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, Jack, do you think that is true?&rdquo;
demanded Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is we ought to march over to Pornell
Academy and wipe them off the face of the earth,&rdquo;
said Fred Century. &ldquo;This looks just like Roy
Bock&rsquo;s underhanded meanness,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam was notified of the new discovery
made and came down to inspect the damage
done. His face grew very stern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is positive vandalism,&rdquo; was his comment.
&ldquo;If any boy in this school is guilty I shall expel
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will permit me, Captain Putnam, I&rsquo;d
like to say a word,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Major Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think this was done by anybody in our
school. If you will remember, we were all away
to-day to target practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, but one boy, Robert Grenwood,
came back early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I rather think he was in an ugly frame of
mind upon his return,&rdquo; pursued the master of the
school grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be, too, sir. All the same, I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;d do this. Bob isn&rsquo;t that kind of a
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what were you going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of that crowd of Pornell Academy
students we met on the road this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ones in an automobile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&mdash;the fellows who jeered at us and
called us tin soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem! What of them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say too much, sir. But you
know they are down on us,&mdash;and you know how
our flagstaff and our cannon disappeared,&rdquo; went
on the young major, referring to an incident
which had been related in detail in &ldquo;The Putnam
Hall Champions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. And I also know how Doctor Pornell
complained of the disappearance of some
choice trophies belonging to his students,&rdquo; said
Captain Putnam grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they got those trophies back,&rdquo; said a
student in the rear of the crowd, and a snicker
passed among the cadets at the remembrance of
the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows are the worst boys at Pornell,&rdquo;
went on the young major. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d
stop at anything to do this school an injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you prove any of them guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;at least, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can do nothing, for Doctor Pornell
and myself are no longer on speaking terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is clear enough,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Outsiders
wouldn&rsquo;t have any reason to come here and
do this&mdash;unless they had a grudge against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that butcher, Pangborn, did it,&rdquo; suggested
Dale, mentioning a meat dealer who had
had trouble with the captain over his meat bill,
and who no longer supplied the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be.&rdquo; The master of the school drew
a long breath. &ldquo;Well, I shall watch out, and I
want you young gentlemen to do the same. If
you learn of anything, let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>A little later Bob Grenwood came in. From
the target grounds he had walked to Cedarville
and had purchased his supper at the village. He
tried to slip upstairs unobserved, but was caught
by Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! so we have you, you young villain!&rdquo; cried
the teacher, taking him by the collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Bob, somewhat
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough,&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree,
and without further ado marched the ex-quartermaster
to Captain Putnam&rsquo;s private office.
Here Grenwood was put through a great number
of questions. When he learned the drift of things
he was highly indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I am not guilty, and you
ought to know it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It was bad enough
to make me resign my position, this is even
worse. I shall write to my folks and ask them
to take me away from this school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do as you please, Grenwood,&rdquo; was
the captain&rsquo;s cold reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day, perhaps, you&rsquo;ll find out your mistake,&rdquo;
said the cadet, and then, with tears of
anguish and indignation standing in his eyes he
left the office and ran up the stairs to the dormitory
occupied by himself and several others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Left to himself, Captain Putnam leaned his
elbow on his desk and rested his head in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boys! These boys!&rdquo; he murmured to
himself. &ldquo;I hardly know whether to believe them
or not&mdash;they are up to so many tricks! Grenwood
looks honest enough, and yet&mdash;you never can
tell!&rdquo; And he heaved a deep sigh. He was beginning
to learn that after all, running a boarding
school was not such an easy thing as he had at
first supposed. He wanted to do what was just,&mdash;but
he hated to be imposed upon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE NEW TEACHER</span></h2>
<p>The first person the ex-quartermaster encountered
upstairs was Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bob,&rdquo; cried the young major. &ldquo;Just
the person I want to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;some other time, Ruddy,&rdquo; stammered
the youth, whose eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Bob, what&rsquo;s your hurry? Anything
special on?&rdquo; And now Jack caught the other boy
affectionately by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am going to leave this school!&rdquo; was
the bitter response. &ldquo;Captain Putnam hasn&rsquo;t
treated me fairly. I didn&rsquo;t distribute those blanks,
I am certain of it&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t have anything to
do with rough-housing the Hall, either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said you played rough-house here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did&mdash;or he said as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Cedarville. I walked there directly from
the target grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet anybody on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes, a farmer named Laning. He
was driving a team of oxen and wanted to know
what the shooting meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you go when first you got to Cedarville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, just tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the steamboat dock. There I met
the agent, and helped him tow a boat up to Chase
Point. When we got back I went and got supper
at Berry&rsquo;s and then came to the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell the captain all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t give me the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you should have told him. It seems
to me it would be easy for you to prove an <i>alibi</i>,
so far as being here this afternoon is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to bother with it&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to
quit and go home,&rdquo; answered Bob Grenwood
recklessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. Stay, Bob, and face the
music. If you go away it will make it look as if
you were guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Captain Putnam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all upset on account of this awful mix-up.
He&rsquo;ll calm down by to-morrow&mdash;and so will you.
And let me say another thing, Bob. None of us
fellows thinks you distributed the blanks,&mdash;or, if
you did, we are sure it was a pure and simple
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>At this moment came a cry from one of the
dormitories, followed a second later by a yell
from another room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every bed sheet is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are all the night clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is some of the stuff, in the closet, and,
yes, it&rsquo;s tied up in hard knots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about &lsquo;chawin&rsquo; on the beef!&rsquo; It will
take some &lsquo;chawin&rsquo;&rsquo; to get these knots out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I only had the fellow who did this,
wouldn&rsquo;t I give him a piece of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him a piece av me fist!&rdquo; roared Emerald.
&ldquo;Just be after looking at them beautiful pajamas
of mine, toied in about twinty knots!&rdquo;
And he held up the articles of wearing apparel
dolefully.</p>
<p>Jack ran into his dormitory, to find Pepper with
a bundle in his hand. The bundle consisted of
their night clothes and some bed sheets, all
knotted together in a hopeless tangle. Several
similar bundles were in the possession of other
cadets.</p>
<p>The uproar was so great that soon all the
teachers and the servants were on the scene. For
once Captain Putnam was as furious as Josiah
Crabtree had ever been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the vilest kind of an outrage!&rdquo; cried
the master of the Hall. &ldquo;If I find out who is
guilty I&rsquo;ll have that person locked up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy more than one person did this,&rdquo; said
George Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right&mdash;it would take several at least.
What a mess!&rdquo; The captain glanced from room
to room in perplexity. &ldquo;I hardly know what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Captain Putnam, my nightgown is
split from top to bottom,&rdquo; wailed Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the legs of my pajamas is torn off,&rdquo;
growled Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An arm of mine is gone,&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, you will have to straighten out things
as best you can for the night,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam
at last. &ldquo;To-morrow I&rsquo;ll have a thorough
investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets went to work &ldquo;chawin&rsquo; good and
proper,&rdquo; as Andy expressed it, and inside of half
an hour the sheets and night clothing were
straightened out, and then the lads went to bed,
tired but highly excited. All voted that this was
the most strenuous day that had ever come to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam can think as he pleases,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;I am certain in my mind that the Pornell
fellows did this, although how they managed
it without being seen is a wonder to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so difficult, with all the cadets and
all the teachers away,&rdquo; answered Stuffer. &ldquo;They
must have gotten in on the sly and then posted
a guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find out it was really the Pornell fellows
we ought to pay &rsquo;em back,&rdquo; spoke up Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; answered Pepper promptly.</p>
<p>On the following morning both the cadets and
the teachers had calmed down, and Captain Putnam
acted like quite another person. A rigid investigation
was held, but nothing came of it, although
the missing school books were found in a
hall closet. Acting on Jack&rsquo;s advice Bob Grenwood
went to the master of the school and told
his story in detail, adding that he could prove by
Mr. Laning, the farmer, and by the people in
Cedarville how he had put in his time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Grenwood, if you are innocent of this
rough-house work I am glad to know it,&rdquo; answered
Captain Putnam finally. And so that
matter was dropped. But he still believed poor
Grenwood guilty of having distributed the blank
cartridges and refused to reinstate the ex-quartermaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Two days later the new teacher arrived and was
introduced to the cadets by Captain Putnam. Mr.
Pluxton Cuddle proved to be a large man, fully
six feet two inches in height and weighing at least
two hundred pounds. He had a shock of heavy
black hair, a heavy black moustache, and heavy
black eyebrows. When he spoke his voice was
almost a rumble, and he had a manner of shifting
his eyes constantly and of rubbing his hands
together as if soaping them well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we shall get along well together,
young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in a voice that could
be heard out on the campus. &ldquo;Education is a
great thing, a grand thing, and while you are at
this institution you must make the most of your
opportunities. My heart goes out to all boys who
desire to elevate themselves mentally, and you
who love to study will find me your best friend.
In a few days I shall feel more at home here, and
then we will see how much of precious study we
can crowd into the all but too short hours of
school life.&rdquo; And having said this he bowed profoundly
and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! but he&rsquo;s a corker!&rdquo; whispered Pepper
to Jack. &ldquo;I rather think he&rsquo;ll make us sit up and
take notice, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Pep,&rdquo; answered the young major.
&ldquo;If I am any judge he&rsquo;ll be even stricter than
old Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a chap who would carry out his
ideas, once he had made up his mind,&rdquo; came from
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silence in the classroom!&rdquo; called out Captain
Putnam, and then, after a few words more, he
left the new teacher and the students alone. Mr.
Pluxton Cuddle got to work at once, and that day
the boys studied more mathematics, astronomy
and physics than ever before. They found that
Mr. Cuddle was a regular &ldquo;slave driver,&rdquo; as Dale
called him. Even Joe Nelson, studious as he was,
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d want to keep a fellow at it every minute,&rdquo;
he observed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind boning away, but I
want a breathing spell now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the mess hall Pluxton Cuddle made himself
even more disliked than in the classrooms.
Hardly had the cadets at his table begun to eat
when he commenced to find fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The food is really cooked too much,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is not healthy for the human stomach to eat
food so well-done. And, boys, do not overload
your stomachs. An overloaded stomach befogs
the brain. To grow up clear-brained one must eat
little and only that which is rare-done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! does he want to starve us?&rdquo; cried
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shan&rsquo;t starve me!&rdquo; returned Stuffer. He
looked up to see the eyes of the new teacher
fastened on him and his plateful of victuals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you!&rdquo; cried Pluxton Cuddle, pointing a
long finger at poor Stuffer. &ldquo;Do you mean to eat
all that food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; stammered Singleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is entirely too much, young man, entirely
too much. Why, sir, do you know the capacity
of the human stomach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what mine can hold,&rdquo; answered
Stuffer, and at this answer a titter arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half of that food is sufficient for any boy,&rdquo;
went on Pluxton Cuddle, and glared around so
sharply that the tittering stopped at once. &ldquo;You
cannot have a clear brain if you stuff yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam lets me eat what I please,&rdquo;
grumbled Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the captain is making a sad mistake, and
I feel it my duty to rectify it. Take a saucedish
and put half of the food on it, and then eat what
is left on your plate and no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that there was silence, but many of the
cadets looked at each other meaningly. Here was
a brand-new experience. When they got out on
the campus they gathered to talk it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut me off on food!&rdquo; snorted Stuffer. &ldquo;Say,
if this thing keeps up I&rsquo;ll go home. Why, I ain&rsquo;t
had half enough to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Stuffer!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Now see what
you get for pampering your stomach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted some more rice pudding but I didn&rsquo;t
dare to ask for it,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted some more meat,&rdquo; came from Bart
Conners. &ldquo;But he wouldn&rsquo;t let the waiter bring
me any. I think this is the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made me mad was the way Reff Ritter
grinned at me from the next table,&rdquo; continued
Stuffer. &ldquo;He had all he wanted to eat, for they
had Mr. Strong there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad Mr. Strong is going away,&rdquo; was
Jack&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t stay long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does he go?&rdquo; inquired another pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing this Cuddle knows is lessons,&rdquo;
said Dale. &ldquo;There is no denying he is learned&mdash;more
so even than old Crabtree. But I must say
I like him even less than Crabtree&mdash;and that is
saying a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how Captain Putnam came to pick
him out,&rdquo; said Henry Lee. &ldquo;There are plenty of
good teachers to be had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came well recommended,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;I heard Mr. Strong say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Wish he had stayed home,&rdquo; growled
Pepper. &ldquo;If this sort of thing keeps on, I&rsquo;ll rebel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>And several others said the same. Little did
they dream then, however, of the rebellion so
close at hand, and of the adventures which were
to follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">AN ENCOUNTER ON THE LAKE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out for a sail,&rdquo; said Jack, on Saturday
afternoon. &ldquo;Will you go along, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the ready response. &ldquo;Anybody
else going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dale and Stuffer. Fred Century is going
out in his boat too, and take several others of our
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to race again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered the young major.
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said anything. Of course I&rsquo;ll race him
if he wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>As my old readers know, there had been in the
past two races between the <i>Alice</i>, the sloop owned
by Jack, and the <i>Ajax</i>, the craft belonging to Fred
Century. These had taken place while Fred was
a student at Pornell Academy. In the first race a
sudden gust of wind capsized the <i>Ajax</i> and Jack
and his chums had to go to the rescue of Fred and
his friends. In the second race, which included
another sloop belonging to a young man who lived
near the two schools, the <i>Alice</i> came in ahead,
with the <i>Ajax</i> second. On this race Roy Bock
and his cronies lost considerable money by betting,
and they circulated a story that Fred had &ldquo;sold
out&rdquo; to the Putnam Hall boys. This caused a
great rumpus, and a fight in which Bock and
several other Pornell students got a good drubbing.
Then Fred had a bitter interview with
Doctor Pornell, and left the Academy and came
to Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>The two sloops, looking very much alike, now
that both flew the colors of the Hall, were soon
standing up the lake in a breeze which was just
sufficient to fill the sails. Each carried a party of
four, and all the boys were in the best of spirits
in spite of another &ldquo;run in&rdquo; with Pluxton Cuddle
over the matter of eating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll race you for a
couple of miles!&rdquo; sang out Fred, who was handling
the tiller of the <i>Ajax</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to get beat again?&rdquo; asked the young
major, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to prove to you that the <i>Ajax</i> is
just as good a sloop as the <i>Alice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll race if you want to. What&rsquo;s the
course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From here to Borden&rsquo;s Cove, if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want to capsize again?&rdquo; questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know enough to take in sail now,&rdquo;
answered Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; sang out the owner of the <i>Alice</i>.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the prize for winning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quart of baked ice-cream,&rdquo; answered Fred
merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Add a dozen stuffed pancakes fried in ice and
I&rsquo;ll go you!&rdquo; called the young major. &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go! And catch me if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch me, you mean!&rdquo; yelled Fred, and then
both skippers settled down to handle their respective
craft as best they knew how. Each had his
topsail broken out, and each made his passengers
sit so as to make his sloop ride on as even a keel
as possible.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day for a race, warm and
clear, with scarcely a cloud in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said Pepper, as they
bowled along over the course. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take a
swim. I know the water must be dandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you&mdash;after this race is over,&rdquo;
answered Dale.</p>
<p>Side by side the two sloops kept on the course
until Cat Point was rounded. Then the <i>Ajax</i> began
slowly to crawl ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;There! What did I tell you!&rdquo; cried Fred
Century. &ldquo;See how we are going ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This race isn&rsquo;t over yet,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>They had passed the spot where the mishap had
occurred to the <i>Ajax</i> and were now heading
directly for Borden&rsquo;s Cove. Soon the <i>Alice</i> began
to crawl up and presently passed the <i>Ajax</i>. Those
on Jack&rsquo;s craft gave a cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t beat the <i>Alice</i>, Fred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want a tow we&rsquo;ll throw you a rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, this race isn&rsquo;t over yet!&rdquo; called Fred,
and swung his tiller over a little. At once his
sloop began to move faster, and soon the two
craft were side by side again. And this position
they kept until the Cove was gained and the race
had come to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to call it a tie!&rdquo; declared the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tie it is,&rdquo; answered the owner of the <i>Ajax</i>.
&ldquo;But some day I&rsquo;ll beat you yet,&rdquo; he added, with
a determined shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d rather be beat by you than anybody
else on this lake, Fred,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, that&rsquo;s a nice thing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Jack, and I&rsquo;d rather come in
behind the <i>Alice</i> than behind any other sloop,&rdquo;
added Fred. &ldquo;My opinion is that our boats are
both crackerjacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; came from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to give them away, I&rsquo;ll take
either,&rdquo; said Andy, with an innocent look, and this
remark caused a general laugh.</p>
<p>The boys found a secluded spot, and tying up
the two sloops, went ashore and began to get
ready for a swim. Soon Pepper plunged into the
clear water and Andy and the others followed. It
felt a trifle cold at first, but they soon got used to
it, and they dove, splashed, and swam around to
their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on and race!&rdquo; sang out Pepper, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; called Dale, and side by side they
struck out for a distant rock. The others joined
in, and in a few minutes all were some distance
away from where they had left the sloops
and their clothing.</p>
<p>In the meantime a large gasolene motor boat
had come up the shore of the lake. It contained
a pleasure party from Pornell Academy, including
Roy Bock, Grimes, Gussic, Sedley, and several
others. The motor boat was an easy-running affair
and under reduced speed made little noise,
so the swimmers did not notice its approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, I see two sloops in the Cove,&rdquo; remarked
Roy Bock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of &rsquo;em is Fred Century&rsquo;s boat,&rdquo; said
Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the other is the boat belonging to
Jack Ruddy,&rdquo; added Gussic. &ldquo;Nobody on board,&rdquo;
he went on, after a close look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have gone ashore,&rdquo; remarked Sedley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are, over by that rock, swimming,&rdquo;
said Will Carey, who was present.</p>
<p>The motor boat had come to a stop and now the
wind blew it inshore behind a clump of overhanging
bushes. From this point those on board
watched the antics of the swimmers for several
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; cried Roy Bock suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I!&rdquo; added Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tow their sloops out into the lake and
cast them adrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to take their clothes and hide
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, let&rsquo;s do both!&rdquo; put in Will Carey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to be careful,&rdquo; added another student
who was present. &ldquo;If we get caught&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t caught the other day, when we
turned Putnam Hall inside out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&mdash;but the cadets are close by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it. We can tie something over our
faces, and over the name of the motor boat,&rdquo; said
Gussic.</p>
<p>This advice was acted on, and then two of
the boys stole ashore and gathered up the heaps
of wearing apparel Jack and his chums had left
there. In the meantime Roy Bock got out some
ropes, with which to tow away the <i>Ajax</i> and the
<i>Alice</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this won&rsquo;t put them in a pickle nothing
will,&rdquo; said the bully of Pornell Academy. &ldquo;Miles
from their school and nothing to wear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best joke we ever played on them,&rdquo;
answered Gussic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, you fellows!&rdquo; called Roy Bock to
those who were gathering up the clothing. &ldquo;Be
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; yelled a voice suddenly, and from
some bushes rushed Joe Nelson, a trowel in one
hand and some wild plants in another. &ldquo;What
are you doing with that clothing? Who does it
belong to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, who is this chap?&rdquo; muttered one
of the Pornell students who had come ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; yelled Joe. &ldquo;Some fellows running
off with this clothing! Cadets ahoy!&rdquo; For he
saw that the bundles contained Putnam Hall
uniforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; called back Jack. He swam to a
rock. &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; he gasped, looking into
the Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; questioned Pepper,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fellows at our clothing! And look,
there&rsquo;s a motor boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and tying fast to our sloops!&rdquo; gasped
Fred Century. &ldquo;Stop, you thieves!&rdquo; he bawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that clothing alone!&rdquo; commanded Joe, and
ran forward with his trowel uplifted as if it was a
dagger. &ldquo;Drop them, I say, or somebody will
get hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His attitude was so fierce that the students from
Pornell Academy let the bundles fall and ran back
to the motor boat with all speed. Bock was also
alarmed, both at the shouts from shore and from
the swimmers at a distance, and had shoved off,
so the pair had to wade in up to their knees to get
on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to leave us behind, Roy?&rdquo; demanded
one, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we haven&rsquo;t any time to waste,&rdquo; said
the bully. &ldquo;Here they come, like a band of wild
Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>And Jack and his chums certainly did look like
wild men as they rushed along the shore, catching
up rocks as they did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, or I&rsquo;ll hit you with a stone!&rdquo; called out
Pepper, and then let fly a missile that whizzed so
close to Roy Bock&rsquo;s head that the bully dodged.
More stones followed, thrown by Jack and the
other swimmers and by Joe Nelson, and several
students on the motor boat were hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; screamed Will Carey. &ldquo;You
may kill somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave those sloops alone!&rdquo; called Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know you, Roy Bock,&rdquo; added Fred. &ldquo;And
you too, Gussic and Carey. You clear out mighty
quick, or you&rsquo;ll get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a right to come here if we want to,&rdquo;
growled Bock, seeing that the chance to play the
Putnam Hall lads a trick had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But you have no right to touch our
boats,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor our clothing,&rdquo; added Andy. &ldquo;Joe, how is
it that you are here?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was digging plants in the woods when I
heard some talking,&rdquo; answered Joe Nelson. &ldquo;I
came to the shore just in time to see two of that
crowd gathering up your clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, it was lucky you arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the boats deserted,&rdquo; said Sedley.
&ldquo;We were going to tow them down to your dock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell that to your grandmother, Sedley,&rdquo; retorted
Dale. &ldquo;You were going to run away with
the sloops&mdash;and run away with our clothing too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on a level with the joke you played at
Putnam Hall the other day,&rdquo; added Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What joke?&rdquo; demanded Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; retorted the Pornell
student uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know how we found you
out,&rdquo; added Jack, pinching Pepper&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that Captain
Putnam is going to swear out a warrant for your
arrest,&rdquo; added The Imp, as he returned Jack&rsquo;s
pinch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our arrest!&rdquo; cried Roy Bock, in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t dare to do it. If he does&mdash;well, we
haven&rsquo;t forgotten how you came to our school
one night and stole all our trophies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just wait and see what he does,&rdquo; said
Jack, calmly. And then he started to dress and
his chums did the same. Roy Bock wanted to
talk some more, but the young major cautioned
his chums to keep silent, and at last the motor
boat and its occupants moved away across the
lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve found them out,&rdquo; declared Pepper.
&ldquo;They are responsible for that rough-housing
right enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we have them guessing as to what
Captain Putnam is going to do about it,&rdquo;
answered Jack with a grin. &ldquo;Maybe they won&rsquo;t
sleep much to-night, thinking it over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get square on them, for that and for
their attempt to take our boats and our clothing,&rdquo;
declared Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet we will!&rdquo; declared Andy; and all of
the others agreed with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">STARCHING AND BLUEING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;To get square with those Pornell fellows
means two things,&rdquo; remarked Jack, as the boys
proceeded to push off and out of the Cove. &ldquo;One
is to do something worth while, and the other is
to keep Captain Putnam in the dark about the
rough-house affair. If we raise a row about
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pornell students will raise a row if we
do anything and are found out,&rdquo; finished Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we can keep still, since the captain
has admitted he thinks Bob Grenwood innocent
of the affair,&rdquo; remarked Dale.</p>
<p>On the arrival at the Hall the two sloops were
tied up at the dock, and the boys drifted down to
the gymnasium, where Andy did some wonderful
&ldquo;stunts&rdquo; on the rings and bars. Jack drew some
of his chums aside and in a corner it was discussed
how accounts might be &ldquo;squared up&rdquo; with
the Pornellites.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;d like to do,&rdquo; grumbled Stuffer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to present them with Pluxton Cuddle.
They could have him and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, have you had more trouble?&rdquo; questioned
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have! What do you think! I was
eating some candy I bought in town last week and
he told me to throw it away&mdash;that it would ruin
my digestion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fierce,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;Sure, and where
is this tyranny to stop, I don&rsquo;t know! Next thing
ye know he won&rsquo;t let us eat at all, at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we give Cuddle a lesson&mdash;after we get
through with Pornell,&rdquo; said Bart Conners, and
this suggestion was hailed with satisfaction by all
present.</p>
<p>One of the boys had learned that a number of
Pornell students were going to a party on the
following Wednesday afternoon. The affair was
to be given by a number of girls at a place called
Lakelawn, a mile from the Academy. Among
the invited guests were Bock and several of his
cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think!&rdquo; said the cadet who
gave this news. &ldquo;Reff Ritter, Coulter and Paxton
are also invited and I believe they are to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to do something to spoil that fun,&rdquo;
said Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us think it over,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon Pepper learned through
Mumps that Ritter, Coulter and Paxton had accepted
the invitation to Lakelawn and expected to
have a &ldquo;large time,&rdquo; to use Ritter&rsquo;s own words.</p>
<p>At the time the school sneak gave this information
to Pepper the latter was eating candy from
a bag he had purchased. Mumps wanted some of
that candy and he lingered around even after
Pepper had given him several chocolates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;Give me some more
chocolates and I&rsquo;ll tell you something very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about, Mumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Ritter and his crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have just told me about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let me have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me the chocolates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;if the news is of importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All there are left in the bag.&rdquo; The Imp
twisted the top of the candy bag shut as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The school sneak looked around
the hall, to make certain nobody was listening.
&ldquo;Ritter and his crowd are going to do you up
brown to-night,&rdquo; he said coarsely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do us up brown? What do you mean?&rdquo; And
now Pepper was all attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any particulars. But I heard
Reff say that, when he was talking to Coulter,
Paxton and Sabine. I think they are going to
visit your dormitory after you are asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch much, for Reff saw me and
ordered me away. I heard them mention starch.
He told some kind of a joke about putting the
starch in you instead of taking it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; mused Pepper. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But don&rsquo;t say I told you, please!&rdquo;
pleaded Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. And here is the candy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Imp held out the bag and the sneak
snatched it eagerly, and looked inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said, indignantly. &ldquo;There is only
one chocolate in the bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave you all I had left&mdash;just as I promised,&rdquo;
answered Pepper with a grin, and walked away,
leaving the sneak much crestfallen.</p>
<p>Pepper lost no time in hunting up Jack and
some of the others and relating all he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be on our guard to-night,&rdquo; said the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this talk about starch?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that to-day is wash day and the wash-women
in the laundry are using a lot of starch,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;Maybe Ritter and his gang
think to steal some and use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! if they do that I know what I&rsquo;ll
do!&rdquo; cried Pepper, struck by a sudden idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they try to starch us why can&rsquo;t we blue
them? We can get some of the blueing balls
from the laundry, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good? Just the cheese!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;Blueing
is better than starching any day!&rdquo; And he
laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>The boys laid their plans with care, and retired
to their dormitory at an early hour. They
had a little studying to do and got through with
their lessons as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am going out and play enemy,&rdquo; said
Pepper, when it was time to retire. &ldquo;Remember,
when I whistle it means get busy!&rdquo; And he stole
forth out of the dormitory and down the semi-dark
hallway with the silence of a shadow.</p>
<p>When he reached the doorway of the room
Ritter and his cronies occupied he paused and
listened intently. A low murmur of voices
reached his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fellows all ready?&rdquo; he heard Ritter
ask, presently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the general answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody got his can of starch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get any more starch so I got mucilage,&rdquo;
answered Paxton. &ldquo;I reckon it will be just
as sticky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others said they had starch, and then Reff
Ritter came to the door and opened it softly.
Pepper was too quick for him, however, and hid
out of sight around an angle of the hall.</p>
<p>The conspirators had scarcely left the dormitory
when Pepper entered it and spent several
minutes inside. Then he came out on the run, a
handkerchief tied over his face.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ritter and his crowd had entered
the room Jack and the others occupied.
They were about to pour the cans of starch and
mucilage over the beds, where they supposed the
cadets were reposing, when something unexpected
happened. From out of two closets leaped Jack,
Andy and the others, each with a wet and knotted
towel in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At them, fellows!&rdquo; cried the young major.
And whack! came his wet towel on Reff Ritter&rsquo;s
head, sending the water flying into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! stop!&rdquo; roared the bully, taken completely
off his guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Whack! whack! whack! went the wet and
knotted towels, and every one of the intruders received
several cracks on the head and in the face.
The cloths were so saturated with moisture that
the water flew in all directions, wetting them completely.
Ritter and his crowd were so bewildered
they knew not what to do and forget all about
using the cans of starch. Coulter let his can drop
and then slipped on the contents, pulling another
boy down on top of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Ritter, get back to your room! Old Crabtree
is coming!&rdquo; called out Pepper in a disguised
voice from the hallway, and then, more scared
than ever, the bully turned and darted from the
dormitory and his cohorts followed. In the darkness
Pepper tripped the bully up, sending him
headlong on his nose. Then Pepper darted into
the dormitory, and the door was shut and locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time we caught them on the fly,&rdquo;
cried Jack, joyously. &ldquo;My, but didn&rsquo;t we give it
to &rsquo;em good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you wet them all,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll have a fine time drying themselves&mdash;if
they get hold of the towels I fixed up,&rdquo;
grinned The Imp.</p>
<p>They waited and heard Ritter and his cronies
enter the dormitory at the end of the hallway.
Then they stole forth, Pepper leading the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who said Crabtree was coming?&rdquo; they heard
Ritter ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been some friend from another
dormitory,&rdquo; answered Billy Sabine. &ldquo;Ugh! I&rsquo;m
soaked through!&rdquo; And he shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word, I got a crack right in the
nose and it&rsquo;s bleeding,&rdquo; growled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the crack or the nose?&rdquo; queried Paxton
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, this ain&rsquo;t no time to joke! Where is
there a towel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towels were handy&mdash;Pepper had seen to that&mdash;and
one after another of those in the dormitory
caught up a cloth and began to wipe the water
from his face and neck. They were doing this
vigorously by a dim light when of a sudden
Coulter let out a yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your face, Paxton?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My face? Nothing, only it&rsquo;s mighty wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as blue as indigo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as blue as indigo and all streaked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Paxton ran to a glass and gave a look.
But before he could say a word Reff Ritter gave
a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands are all blue&mdash;and so is my nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue too!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy Sabine. &ldquo;Oh,
what has happened to us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they had blue paint in those towels,&rdquo;
suggested Coulter. &ldquo;Gosh, if this ain&rsquo;t fierce!
We look like a lot of painted Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we do!&rdquo; cried another student. &ldquo;Wonder
if it will wash off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reff Ritter turned up the light and examined
a towel closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what it is!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Somebody has
put blueing powder all over the towels. The
water has made a regular dye of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came in a groaning chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the&mdash;the blueing wash off?&rdquo; asked
Paxton, in a faint voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think all of it will&mdash;it&rsquo;s too strong,&rdquo;
answered Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet this is some of the
Ruddy crowd&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he added bitterly.</p>
<p>Just then a sheet of paper was thrust under the
door. Coulter picked it up. A patter of footsteps
could be heard in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager it is from
those fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought the sheet of paper to the light and
read it, the others gazing over his shoulders. On
the sheet was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for the starching. We
return the compliment by doing the blueing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; growled Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Blueing
indeed? If we can&rsquo;t get this stuff off we won&rsquo;t
want to show ourselves in the classrooms to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about the party at Lakelawn?&rdquo;
groaned Gus Coulter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that, Reff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t clean up we&rsquo;ll have to stay at home.
I don&rsquo;t want to go looking like a bluejay, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get square with the Ruddy
crowd for this,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;Oh, what a
mess!&rdquo; And he did his best to get the blueing
from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter,
savagely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get square if it takes a thousand
years!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED AT THE ICE HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>The next morning Reff Ritter had to excuse
himself, and he did not come downstairs all day.
Some of the blueing had gotten on his nose and
refused to come off. Paxton and Coulter appeared,
and they looked &ldquo;blue&rdquo; in more ways than
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to square up some day!&rdquo;
growled Coulter, when he met Pepper. &ldquo;Just
wait, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that you don&rsquo;t burn your fingers
doing it,&rdquo; answered The Imp. &ldquo;Remember, we
can give you as good as you send, every time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter and Paxton still had some of the blueing
on them and some of the cadets not in the
secret wanted to know what was the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had some blue ink and it got spilled,&rdquo;
answered Paxton, and that was all he and Coulter
would say. When Captain Putnam went upstairs
to call on Ritter and make sure he was not
seriously sick the bully told the same story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be careful the next time,&rdquo; said the
master of the Hall, and he left Ritter in deep
thought. He felt almost certain some kind of a
joke had been played, but he did not wish to investigate,
having his hands full with other things.
George Strong had departed, having received a
special message of importance, and the captain
himself had to leave the school the following
Monday, to go to Chicago.</p>
<p>In a roundabout way Jack and his chums
learned that Reff Ritter, Coulter and Paxton were
going to attend the lawn party in spite of the
blueing that still showed on their hands and
faces, and they at once set to work to see what
could be done toward having more fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be rather a delicate proceeding,&rdquo;
said the young major. &ldquo;Remember, we
have two crowds to deal with&mdash;Ritter&rsquo;s and Roy
Bock&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better divide our forces?&rdquo;
suggested Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a plan, but I don&rsquo;t know if it can be
carried out,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;To my mind, Ritter
and Bock are quite friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a case of one bully loving another,&rdquo;
chimed in Stuffer. &ldquo;They are thick, and so are
Coulter and Gussic and Grimes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I can get this plan to work after
all,&rdquo; went on The Imp, and then he told the others
of his scheme. This was nothing more than to
send a letter to Bock asking him and his cronies
to meet Ritter at a certain ice-house on the lake
front, at two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;just an hour before the
party was to come off. Another letter was to be
sent to Ritter asking him to meet Bock and his
crowd at the same place, but a little earlier.</p>
<p>The letters were written without delay and a
farm boy of that vicinity was hired to deliver
them both at noon on the day the party was to
come off. Each letter spoke of &ldquo;a way to fix
Ruddy and his crowd,&rdquo; and was unsigned.</p>
<p>As Pepper anticipated, Bock and Ritter and
their cohorts fell into the trap readily. Each
bully was more than anxious to learn of something
whereby he might do the young major and
his chums injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter is a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Roy Bock, to his
cronies. &ldquo;He hates Ruddy and those other chaps
like poison, too. He must have something great
up his sleeve.&rdquo; And the others agreed this must
be so; and all voted to stop at the ice-house on the
way to the lawn party.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ritter was equally enthusiastic,
and so were Coulter and Paxton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work with the Pornell fellows in this,&rdquo;
said the Hall bully. &ldquo;I always liked Bock, and
if he will show us how to turn a trick on Ruddy
I&rsquo;ll like him better than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy matter for Jack, Pepper and the
others to get away early on the day the lawn party
was to be held. Yet they managed it by various
excuses, and then met back of the gymnasium,
and hurried at top speed to the ice house.</p>
<p>The structure was empty, the last of the former
winter&rsquo;s ice having been removed the week before.
It was a large and gloomy place, and scattered
around were many tons of wet sawdust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now boys, follow my directions and be quick
about it!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Andy, you keep an eye
open and let us know as soon as you see anybody.
Jack, here&rsquo;s your make-up,&rdquo; and as he finished
speaking he handed over a suit of plain clothes
and a hat, such as Bock was in the habit of wearing.
These the young major donned with all
speed, and pulled down his hair over his forehead,
in the style Bock affected. This done, at a distance
he resembled the bully of Pornell Academy.</p>
<p>The cadets set to work doing various things in
the ice house that Pepper suggested. Hardly had
they completed their labors when Andy gave a
low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter and his crowd are coming!&rdquo; he called,
as he came into the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>It was now that Jack acted. He ran to the
doorway, and seeing Ritter at a distance waved
his hand wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up! You&rsquo;re late!&rdquo; he called out, imitating
Bock&rsquo;s voice as much as possible.</p>
<p>Not dreaming that anything was wrong, Reff
Ritter and his cronies quickened their pace and
soon came up to the ice house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; called out Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, inside,&rdquo; was the muffled answer. &ldquo;Come
in, the place is empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter entered, followed by Coulter and Paxton.
They saw somebody move at the rear end of the
building and started in that direction. Each had
hardly taken a dozen steps when he found himself
attacked from behind. A long bag was thrown
over his head and pulled to his knees and tied fast
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you! What does this mean?&rdquo; roared Ritter,
trying in vain to clear himself of the bag.
Then he commenced to cough, for the bag was
full of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence&mdash;unless you want to be buried deep
in the sawdust,&rdquo; commanded Jack, in a heavy,
unnatural voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; spluttered Paxton. &ldquo;If yo&mdash;you
bury us in that we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll smother to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;who are you fel&mdash;fellows?&rdquo; gasped
Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are the Pornell Academy boys, and we
mean to keep you from that party,&rdquo; answered
Andy, in a voice that sounded much like that of
Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck!&rdquo; growled Reff Ritter.
&ldquo;Say, Bock, this isn&rsquo;t fair. You said in the letter
you would help us to get Jack Ruddy into
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! you were nicely fooled!&rdquo; laughed
Jack, still disguising his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo; ordered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t budge!&rdquo; cried Paxton.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he spoken when he felt a whip
lash across his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Oh, let up! I&rsquo;ll march!&rdquo; he whined.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lash me again, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were absolutely helpless with the
strong bags tied down to their knees, Ritter
Coulter and Paxton had to do as commanded, and
they were marched out of a back door of the ice
house and to a grove of trees some distance away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, boys!&rdquo; whispered Pepper, to his
chums. &ldquo;Somebody is coming down the road. It
must be the Pornell Academy crowd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a twinkling the prisoners were tied with
ropes to several trees. Then Jack led the way
back to the ice house. Here Pepper went to the
front, while the major resumed his uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows!&rdquo; cried Pepper, as soon as
he was sure of the party approaching. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
all day! Hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too warm to hurry!&rdquo; called back Roy
Bock. &ldquo;Do you think I want to get all heated
up?&rdquo; He was faultlessly dressed in his best, and
so were his cronies, for nearly all of the Pornell
students were rich and spent a good deal upon
their attire.</p>
<p>They walked into the ice house just as Ritter
and the others had done. It was Dale who called
them to the rear, and then the others came up behind
with another set of long bags and ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up!&rdquo; roared Roy Bock, and began to fight
with such vigor that he almost broke away. But
Jack held fast and both went down into the wet
sawdust, much to Bock&rsquo;s disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, you&rsquo;ve ruined my best suit!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for this, see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get the chance,&rdquo; answered Jack in
a disguised voice. &ldquo;Glad you answered my letter,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is what you were up to, eh?&rdquo; stormed
the Pornell bully, after further resistance was useless.
With the bag over him he could, of course,
see nothing. &ldquo;What are you going to do with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, only keep you here while we enjoy
that lawn party,&rdquo; answered Pepper, in a disguised
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plot against us!&rdquo; groaned Grimes. &ldquo;I
told you to be cautious about coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ritter, I thought I could trust you,&rdquo; continued
Roy Bock. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t fair at all. I
thought we were going to hatch out something
against Ruddy, Ditmore, and those fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; murmured Dale, and he had all
he could do to keep from laughing over the turn
of affairs. Andy was in a corner, holding his
sides and chuckling, and all of the other cadets
were grinning broadly.</p>
<p>The Pornell students wanted to argue, but Jack
and his chums would not listen. With strong
ropes they tied each of the enemy fast to a beam
in the ice house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;ll be back bye and bye,&rdquo; cried Jack, in an
unnatural voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us!&rdquo; cried Gussic. &ldquo;This bag is
horribly dirty. I&rsquo;ve got my whole head full of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back!&rdquo; yelled Ritter, from his bag.
&ldquo;Say, if you&rsquo;ll let us out we&rsquo;ll call it square. If
you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; asked Jack, from a distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Report you to Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; was the young major&rsquo;s
answer, and then he and his chums departed,
rolling the ice house door shut as they did so.
They waited till they had covered a hundred yards
or so and then of a sudden every cadet present
burst into a roar of merriment that lasted for
several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the richest ever!&rdquo; cried Andy, the tears
fairly running down his cheeks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em
all prisoners and each party thinks the other
guilty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of Roy Bock reporting to Captain
Putnam for this!&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that
make you scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe Ritter will report Bock and his
gang to Doctor Pornell,&rdquo; suggested Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, and its the foinest mix-up I ever seen
in me life,&rdquo; was Emerald&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;If only
they meet some day an&rsquo; fight it out!&rdquo; And the
grin on his broad face spread from ear to ear.</p>
<p>The crowd walked down to the lake shore and
then to the place where the lawn party was in
progress. They saw a dozen or more girls in
the grounds, but only five boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard luck for the girls,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s
comment. &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pity them,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t
invite me,&mdash;and I once took two of them rowing,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they didn&rsquo;t invite me&mdash;and I once
treated three of them to ice-cream soda,&rdquo; added
Dale.</p>
<p>The boys watched the party from a distance,
and then, when it was growing late, started again
in the direction of the ice house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! what is that?&rdquo; called Andy suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like somebody fighting,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what it is,&rdquo; burst out Jack.
&ldquo;Come, follow me!&rdquo; And he dove into the bushes
lining the roadway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A MIX-UP ON THE ROAD</span></h2>
<p>As luck would have it, Reff Ritter&rsquo;s party and
the crowd from Pornell Academy had become
free at the same time, each working out of the
ropes and bags in a manner known only to themselves.
Each had brushed up as much as possible
and started hurriedly for the place where the lawn
party was in progress. The two crowds had come
together on the road not over two hundred yards
from the ice house. Each accused the other of
being guilty of the trick, and in less than five
minutes blows were being freely exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you what it means to treat me like
a pig!&rdquo; cried Roy Bock, and he struck Ritter
a blow in the nose that drew blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t bluff me!&rdquo; retorted the Putnam
Hall bully, and hit the lad from Pornell in the left
eye. Then the pair clinched and rolled over and
over in the dirt of the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>In the meantime Grimes struck Coulter and
Paxton hit Gussic. Then everybody struck out,
and inside of a minute the three Putnam Hall boys
were down and the enemy were on top of them.
Clothing was torn, collars and ties pulled off, and
the general mel&eacute;e was something awful to behold.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this excitement that Jack
and his chums arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whow!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Say, but they are going
at each other for keeps, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s fightin&rsquo; like cats an&rsquo; dogs they
are,&rdquo; was Hogan&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bit av
Donnybrook Fair,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Oh, for a shillalah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pornell crowd isn&rsquo;t fighting fair,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;They outnumber our fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; demanded Dale. &ldquo;I reckon Ritter,
Coulter and Paxton are getting all they
deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ge&mdash;get off of m&mdash;me!&rdquo; came in a groan from
Paxton. &ldquo;Yo&mdash;you are crushing in my ribs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me with that stone!&rdquo; they heard
Coulter scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are certainly going too far,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Enough is enough. Let us scare the
Pornell fellows off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed to, and picking up sticks and
stones Jack&rsquo;s crowd set up a sudden wild yelling
that made the Pornellites stop fighting and glance
around in fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Putnam Hall to
the rescue! Down with Pornell Academy!&rdquo; And
he looked over his shoulder, as if urging others
behind him. Then Jack and the others took up
the cue, and they made it appear as if a big party
was approaching. Andy even ran behind some
bushes and called out in as many different tones
of voice as he could master.</p>
<p>The ruse worked to perfection, and Roy Bock
and his cohorts lost no time in leaping to their
feet and retreating a few paces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the whole school is coming!&rdquo; said the
bully of Pornell Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge them! Charge them!&rdquo; yelled Jack,
and ran forward brandishing a big stick. Pepper
was at his side, and flung a big stone over Bock&rsquo;s
head. This was too much for the Pornell students,
and turning, they ran along the road for a
short distance and then took to the woods. They
did not stop running until they had covered a good
quarter of a mile and were sure the pursuit had
come to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a put-up job!&rdquo; growled Roy Bock, as
he leaned against a tree to rest and catch his
breath. &ldquo;That was Ruddy came to help Ritter
and the others. It was a put-up job and nothing
else!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we walked into the trap like a lot of
mice after cheese,&rdquo; grunted Gussic, with his hand
on his windpipe, where he had been hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at these duds!&rdquo; came from another
lad. &ldquo;About fit for the ragbag!&rdquo; And he mournfully
surveyed a torn sleeve and a hole in his
trouser leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My collar is gone, and so is that new dollar
tie I bought for the party,&rdquo; said Bock. &ldquo;I ought
to make somebody buy me another tie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the party,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo; stormed the bully. &ldquo;Are you crazy?
If we went the girls would take us for scarecrows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny that other crowd didn&rsquo;t go to the
party,&rdquo; remarked Grimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess they&rsquo;d rather play a trick on us
than go to any party,&rdquo; was Gussic&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I
am of the firm opinion that Ritter, Ruddy and the
whole bunch was in the plot against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; answered Roy Bock. And then
he and his cronies walked slowly in the direction
of Pornell Academy, wondering what they should
say when they got there, and what sort of excuse
they should send to the girls who had been waiting
for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>In the meantime Reff Ritter and his cronies had
gotten up and brushed themselves off. They were
considerably astonished to find that Jack and his
chums had come to their rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! So it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; growled Ritter, with a
far from pleasant look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young major cheerily. &ldquo;I
guess we got here just in the nick of time, didn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row about?&rdquo; questioned Pepper
innocently, but with a side wink at Andy and
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About? They tied us up in bags, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Paxton, when a cold look from Reff Ritter
stopped him. &ldquo;I mean&mdash;er&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what it was about,&rdquo; growled
Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tied you up in bags, did they?&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;That was hard luck sure. How did you
escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cut my way from the bag with my pocketknife,&rdquo;
said Coulter, ignoring Ritter&rsquo;s look.
&ldquo;Those fellows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, can&rsquo;t you keep it to yourself?&rdquo; demanded
the bully of the Hall sourly. He was afraid Jack
and his chums would laugh at him and those who
had suffered with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter, you needn&rsquo;t tell us anything,&rdquo; said the
young major, drawing himself up, stiffly. &ldquo;We
did what we could for you, but we don&rsquo;t expect
either your confidence or your thanks.&rdquo; He
turned to his chums. &ldquo;Come, fellows, I fancy we
are not wanted here,&rdquo; and he turned and walked
in the direction of Putnam Hall, with Pepper and
the rest at his heels. Each boy wanted to laugh
but each managed to keep a straight face until a
safe distance was covered. Then Pepper had to
roll on the ground and roar, and Andy did the
same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; panted The Imp, when he felt able
to speak. &ldquo;That was the richest yet&mdash;what you
said&mdash;&lsquo;We did what we could for you, but we
don&rsquo;t expect your thanks!&rsquo; Gracious, I thought
I&rsquo;d die when you said it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em guessing,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I reckon Bock and his gang and
Ritter and his cronies will be enemies for life
now,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, in honor of this occasion, I move we
celebrate to-night,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion,&rdquo; answered Andy, promptly.
&ldquo;But how is it to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might each do an extra example in geometry,
in honor of the event,&rdquo; suggested Jack, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geometry!&rdquo; snorted Stuffer. &ldquo;Not much!
Let&rsquo;s have something to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffer&rsquo;s one idea of celebrating is something
to eat,&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a feast isn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; said another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going to get anything?&rdquo; asked
Pepper. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go to Cedarville&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Let us have an ice-cream
festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough to say, Andy, but where
are you going to get the cream?&rdquo; asked the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If some of you will make excuses for me after
supper I&rsquo;ll get the cream,&rdquo; answered the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;I can go to Cedarville and back in no
time on my wheel. But I want some money,&rdquo; he
added, suddenly. &ldquo;Poser, the ice-cream man,
doesn&rsquo;t tick anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ice-cream party it is,&rdquo; said Emerald.
&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; I could eat some now, so I could!&rdquo;
And he smacked his lips.</p>
<p>When the cadets got back to Putnam Hall they
washed up hastily and then some of the others
turned over to Andy a portion of their spending
money. Andy got a hasty supper, and then,
watching his chance, stole from the mess hall on
the sly. His bicycle was in the wagon house, and
mounting this he spun along the highway leading
to the town at record-breaking speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Snow go?&rdquo; demanded Pluxton
Cuddle, when he noticed the vacant chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he wasn&rsquo;t feeling well,&rdquo; suggested
Pepper. &ldquo;I noticed he had his hand to his
stomach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He eats too much,&rdquo; grumbled the new teacher.
&ldquo;All of you boys eat more than is good for you.
After this I shall have to keep an eye on Snow.&rdquo;
He glared round the table. &ldquo;Singleton, what is
that you have in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of cake, sir,&rdquo; answered Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have a piece before, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. But I&rsquo;m hungry and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One piece of cake is enough, Singleton. Put
that down and leave the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to go hungry?&rdquo; demanded
Stuffer, half angrily. The strenuous events of
the afternoon had made him unusually hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not allow a cadet to stuff himself. I do
not wonder that some of the boys have given you
the nickname of Stuffer&mdash;although I abhor nicknames.
Leave the room, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old cat!&rdquo; grumbled Paul, under his
breath, and he marched out, with Pluxton Cuddle&rsquo;s
eyes glaring after him. In the meantime
Pepper calmly reached over, took half a dozen
slices of cake and rolled them up in a napkin in
his lap. Seeing this, Jack did the same. When
Pluxton Cuddle chanced to look at the plate a
minute later he stared in amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who took that cake?&rdquo; he thundered.</p>
<p>To this question all the cadets remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me, who took that cake?&rdquo; he repeated,
and looked at each boy in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ate but one piece, Mr. Cuddle!&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all I ate, too,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only Stuffer&mdash;I mean Singleton&mdash;ate more
than one piece,&rdquo; said Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! strange! I thought the plate was
full of cake,&rdquo; murmured Pluxton Cuddle. He
glared again at the cadets. &ldquo;If I find out that
any of you have deceived me I shall punish you
severely. Now finish your suppers!&rdquo; And he
began to munch away vigorously on the dry toast
he was eating. His theory was that a person
should eat very little but masticate that little well,
and he sometimes chewed a mouthful of food
thirty or forty times.</p>
<p>When the meal was over, Pepper and Jack
slipped the napkins full of cake under their jackets
and left the mess hall. Then they took the
cake upstairs and hid the dainty in a safe place.
This done they strolled down the highway leading
to Cedarville, looking for Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be coming soon,&rdquo; remarked the
young major, after a half hour had passed.</p>
<p>They walked a short distance from the Hall
and then sat down on a rock to rest. Here presently
Dale and Stuffer joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Andy?&rdquo; called out Stuffer. &ldquo;I am
hungry enough to eat that ice-cream right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think something is wrong,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He
ought to be back by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be wrong, Jack?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The young major
paused. &ldquo;Somehow, I feel that something serious
has happened to Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Andy had a tumble from his wheel,&rdquo;
suggested Dale. &ldquo;It might have broken down,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us walk toward town and find out,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>To this the others readily consented, and all
set off in the direction of Cedarville. They had
to go around a long curve, and then came to a
spot where the roadway was lined upon either
side with thick brushwood and trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; called out Jack, and ran forward.
&ldquo;At least, here is his wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right about the bicycle. It rested by
the roadside, close to the fallen limb of a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly took a tumble!&rdquo; cried Stuffer.
&ldquo;But where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>This question was answered by a groan that
made all of the cadets start. They turned, peered
into the bushes, and there beheld poor Andy
stretched out on some grass. The blood was
flowing from a wound in his forehead and from
a cut on his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo; cried the young major. &ldquo;Are you
hurt much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the gasped-out reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see the tree limb?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
as he got out his handkerchief to wipe away some
of the blood on his chum&rsquo;s face, so he might see
the extent of the injury. Fortunately the cut was
not deep, and it was easily bound up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That limb came down right in front of me,&rdquo;
was Andy&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;If it had been down before
I got to it I could have cleared it somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stuffer ran to a nearby brook for water, bringing
some in a cone he made of a sheet of writing
paper, and inside of five minutes the sufferer felt
well enough to tell his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming along, guiding the wheel with
one hand and holding the ice-cream with the
other,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;All at once the limb came
down right in front of me. I crashed into it
and landed on some stones in the bushes and
then, I guess, I lost consciousness. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
got to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the ice-cream?&rdquo; asked Stuffer,
and despite Andy&rsquo;s plight the lad who loved
to eat gazed around rather anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&mdash;it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; stammered
Andy. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it on the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not, nor was it anywhere in that vicinity.
The cadets looked at each other suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a trick,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;A trick
to get the cream away from Andy and spoil our
little festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;For look, there is
no tree around here where that limb could come
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others looked around and saw that Dale
was right. Only small trees were in that vicinity
and none of these had lost a branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was a trick, it was a mighty mean one,&rdquo;
was the young major&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Why, the
tumble might have killed Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody, Andy?&rdquo; questioned
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I didn&rsquo;t hear anybody either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad. It must have been a trick.
I wonder if some of our fellows or some fellows
from Pornell Academy played it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains for us to find out,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;And when we do find out&mdash;well, somebody
will suffer, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; answered Jack and Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The other boys helped Andy to his feet. He
was still dizzy and they had to support him on
either side. It was found that the bicycle had
a broken pedal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew who did this,&rdquo; grumbled Andy,
as he started to limp along between Pepper and
Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; And he stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; came simultaneously
from those who were assisting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy did not answer immediately. He began
to search his clothing, going through every pocket
several times. Then he started to hunt around on
the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you lost, Andy?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it valuable?&rdquo; put in Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it valuable?&rdquo; queried Andy. &ldquo;Well, I
just guess yes! It was worth at least two hundred
dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred dollars!&rdquo; exclaimed all of the
others in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Nelson&rsquo;s medal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>That was all the others said&mdash;but it was
enough. Every lad at Putnam Hall knew Joe
Nelson&rsquo;s medal, the one left to Joe by his Uncle
Richard. It was a beautiful racing medal of gold,
set with jewels, and Joe was very proud of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing with Joe&rsquo;s medal?&rdquo;
asked Jack, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pin catch got broken and Joe sent it to
the watchmaker to have another put on. He
asked me to get it for him&mdash;I was with him when
he left it at Bright&rsquo;s shop. I went for it before
I went for the cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you have the medal?&rdquo; asked
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the inside pocket of my jacket, and I had
the pocket fastened with a safety pin, too, to
keep the medal from jumping out on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be somewhere around here,&rdquo; said
Stuffer. &ldquo;Let us make a good search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This they did, but it was of no avail. In the
midst of it Andy set up another cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My change is gone, and so is my ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I have been robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy, can this be true?&rdquo; burst out Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can it be? I couldn&rsquo;t lose my ring
and everything else, could I, by just tumbling
from my bicycle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy must be right&mdash;the sudden coming
down of the tree limb proves it,&rdquo; declared Pepper.
&ldquo;Were you unconscious long?&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are sure you were completely knocked
out when you hit the rock?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;everything got dark and I didn&rsquo;t know
a thing. And, yes, when I came to my senses&mdash;just
before you arrived&mdash;I was in the bushes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then somebody must have carried you from
the road!&rdquo; declared Jack. &ldquo;And that somebody
robbed you!&rdquo; he added, bitterly.</p>
<p>After this there was a moment of silence. The
others looked at Andy, and the acrobatic lad
stared at them blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must have been robbed,&rdquo; he said slowly.
&ldquo;But who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of our fellows would do
it,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;Even Ritter isn&rsquo;t bad
enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the Pornell fellows do it?&rdquo; queried
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered the young major.
&ldquo;Why, this is a prison offence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, who knew you were carrying the
medal?&rdquo; questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody see you get it from the watchmaker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this question Andy&rsquo;s face lit up suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a beggar, who came in and asked Mr.
Bright for the price of a meal. Mr. Bright gave
him five cents and I gave him the same. He was
a tall, hungry looking fellow, with a flat nose,
and, I remember now, he looked greedily at the
gold medal and at the things in the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe he is the guilty man,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would he know enough to come here and
strike Andy down?&rdquo; asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would know, by Andy&rsquo;s uniform, that he
belonged to the Hall,&rdquo; answered the young major.
&ldquo;He may have taken to this road and laid in
wait for Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t like the looks of that chap, even though
I did give him five cents. He looked just as if
he wanted to get his hands on something of
value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he must have taken the ice-cream too,&rdquo;
came mournfully from Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it poisons him,&rdquo; muttered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! The idea of ice-cream poisoning
anybody! Besides, a fellow like that most likely
has the digestion of an ostrich,&rdquo; returned Stuffer.</p>
<p>It was now growing so dark that to look around
further was impossible. Jack and Pepper assisted
Andy, and Dale brought along the broken
bicycle, and thus the crowd returned to Putnam
Hall. At the entrance to the campus they encountered
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; called the teacher, harshly. &ldquo;Where
have you been? Did you have permission to
leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, where is Captain Putnam?&rdquo;
asked Jack, without answering the questions put.
&ldquo;Andy had been hurt and robbed. We&rsquo;ll have to
notify the authorities at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt? Robbed? How?&rdquo; And Josiah Crabtree
was much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was knocked off his wheel and robbed of
a ring, some money and Joe Nelson&rsquo;s fine gold
medal. Is Captain Putnam in his office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume so. But I want to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is valuable here, Mr. Crabtree. We
want to catch the thief if we can,&rdquo; put in Pepper,
and then the whole party hurried to the office of
the master of the Hall before Josiah Crabtree
could detain them further. The teacher&rsquo;s curiosity
was aroused and he stalked after them.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam listened to Andy&rsquo;s story with
keen attention, and then asked all of the boys a
number of questions. Nothing was said about
ice-cream, nor did the captain ask Andy if he had
had permission to go to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not come back at once, after getting
the medal?&rdquo; was the question put.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I went to a couple of stores and
posted a letter at the post-office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that would give the rascal time enough
to get out of the village and make his plans to
waylay you,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam. &ldquo;I
think the least we can do is to try to catch that
beggar and make him give an account of himself.
If he can prove he was in Cedarville at the
time of the robbery, why then you&rsquo;ll have to look
further for the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His army experience had taught Captain Putnam
to act quickly in a case of emergency, and
now, without delay, he had Peleg Snuggers hitch
his fast mare to a buggy, and he and Andy drove
down to Cedarville. Here the local authorities
were interviewed, and two constables and a special
policeman went out on a hunt for the beggar.
The policeman had seen the man, and remembered
how he looked and how he had been dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had an upper set of teeth that were false
and a flat nose,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;He was
dressed in a suit of blue that was too big around
for him but not quite long enough. I saw him
begging down at the steamboat dock, and I told
him if he didn&rsquo;t clear out he&rsquo;d be run in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>A hunt was instituted that very night, and was
kept up for several days. But the beggar had
disappeared and all efforts to locate him seemed
fruitless. A reward was offered by the captain
and by Andy&rsquo;s parents, but brought no results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he&rsquo;s gone, and for good,&rdquo; sighed
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the medal is gone it&rsquo;s gone, and that
is all there is to it,&rdquo; answered Joe Nelson. He
felt the loss of his uncle&rsquo;s gift greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, my father says he will buy you another
medal,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to do that, Andy,&rdquo; was the
quick reply. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault you were
robbed. Besides, I&rsquo;d like to have that particular
medal back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I want my ring,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;My
mother gave me that on my last birthday, and I
prized it highly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe the medal and the ring will turn
up some day,&rdquo; concluded Joe; and there the subject
was dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE BEGINNING OF A REBELLION</span></h2>
<p>As has been said, George Strong had gone
away on business, and now Captain Putnam followed
him. This left the school in charge of
Josiah Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle. That there
might be no dispute regarding authority the master
of the school made it plain to the two assistants
that Crabtree was to have undisputed
sway during school hours and that at other times
Cuddle was to assume command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for it now,&rdquo; said Bart Conners,
after the captain had gone. &ldquo;Just you wait and
see. Crabtree will be as dictatorial as possible
during recitations and Cuddle won&rsquo;t let us call
our souls our own the rest of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll stand just so much,&rdquo; answered Pepper.
&ldquo;Then, if it gets worse, I&rsquo;ll kick.&rdquo; And his
chums said about the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The first trouble arose in the schoolroom. Some
of the boys had a Latin lesson that was extra difficult,
and when they stumbled in the recitation
Crabtree read them a lecture that was bitter in the
extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand that I am now in authority
here,&rdquo; he declared, pompously. &ldquo;I want
no more shirking. The reason you haven&rsquo;t this
lesson is because you are lazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; answered Joe Nelson, with a
flushed face. &ldquo;I did my best on that translation.
But we have never had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Nelson, I want no excuses,&rdquo; roared
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;This lesson is simple enough
for a child to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did my best,&rdquo; put in Jack, half aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, did you speak?&rdquo; demanded the
teacher, whirling around and eyeing the young
major savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, sir. I said I did my best. As Joe
says, we have never had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! Didn&rsquo;t I say I wanted no excuses?
Ditmore, you may translate from the beginning of
paragraph twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t study paragraph twenty-four,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;I thought we were to take to
twenty-two only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said twenty to twenty-five,&rdquo; answered Josiah
Crabtree, coldly. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t translate sit down,
and I&rsquo;ll mark you zero. Ritter, you may translate
paragraph twenty-four for Ditmore&rsquo;s benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The last words were said maliciously, for the
teacher knew that Pepper and Ritter were on bad
terms with each other. Pepper&rsquo;s face reddened
and he scowled. But a moment later he had to
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I&mdash;er&mdash;I am not prepared to
translate,&rdquo; stammered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not prepared to translate. I&mdash;er&mdash;I had
such a headache last night I couldn&rsquo;t study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headache is good!&rdquo; muttered Dale into Pepper&rsquo;s
ear. &ldquo;He was out on the lake having a
good time and smoking cigarettes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the cigarettes made his head ache,&rdquo;
answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that talking!&rdquo; bawled Josiah Crabtree,
and rapped sharply on his desk with a ruler.
&ldquo;Kearney, you may go on with the lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as it chanced, Dave Kearney was an exceptionally
good Latin scholar, so he translated
fairly well, even though he had not looked over
the paragraph given. Then Stuffer was called on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I studied only up to twenty-three,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as far as you said we were to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t contradict me! Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo;
shouted Josiah Crabtree, red in the face with rage.
&ldquo;I know what lessons I give out. Conners, you
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big boy of the class shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go on, but not very well, sir,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I understood we were to go to the end
of paragraph twenty-two only. I may be mistaken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; came from a cadet in the rear
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is!&rdquo; said several others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; shouted Josiah Crabtree,
leaping to his feet and shaking his ruler in the
pupils&rsquo; faces. &ldquo;Silence! I will have silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody got any silence to spare?&rdquo; murmured
Pepper, looking behind him. &ldquo;Mr. Crabtree
wants to borrow some silence.&rdquo; And at this a
snicker went around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have silence!&rdquo; repeated the teacher. &ldquo;If
you are not silent I will keep every one of you in
after school!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; said Jack, arising and facing
the irate teacher boldly. As major of the school
battalion he felt it his duty to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, what do you want?&rdquo; snapped the
teacher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;There has evidently been a mistake made. I
think most of the boys here understood you to
say we were to go to the end of paragraph twenty-two&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; came in a dozen voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! Ruddy, sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, I would suggest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, or I&rsquo;ll make you!&rdquo; stormed Josiah
Crabtree, and leaving his desk he strode down the
aisle with his ruler brandished over his head.</p>
<p>It was a critical moment&mdash;one of the most
critical Putnam Hall had ever seen&mdash;and many
of the cadets present held their breath. Some expected
to see Jack drop into his seat, but the
young major did nothing of the kind. He stood
in a soldierly attitude and looked the angry
teacher full in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sit down or not?&rdquo; demanded Josiah
Crabtree, as he came to a halt in front of the
pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you listen to me, or not, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;
asked Jack. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t, I have nothing more
to say, here. But I&rsquo;ll report the matter to Captain
Putnam when he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; came from several
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree made the mistake and he is afraid to
acknowledge it,&rdquo; said one cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, will you be silent?&rdquo; yelled the teacher.
&ldquo;This is&mdash;er&mdash;outrageous! I never saw such actions
in a schoolroom before! Am I in authority
here, or am I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&mdash;not!&rdquo; squeaked a voice from the
rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk out in the air and forget to return,&rdquo;
added another voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a vacation until Captain Putnam gets
back,&rdquo; suggested a third.</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree trembled with rage and from
red grew white. He waved his ruler wildly in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is&mdash;is rebellion!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Rebellion!
I want everybody to sit down!&rdquo; For all
the cadets were now on their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down yourself!&rdquo; came from Coulter, who
was in the rear, and then somebody threw a book
into the air. More books followed, and several
volumes landed on Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s head and
shoulders. He danced around wildly, trying to
reach some of the cadets with the ruler, but all
kept out of his way.</p>
<p>It was the most exciting time Putnam Hall had
ever witnessed, and the climax was gained when
an inkwell, thrown by Reff Ritter, struck Josiah
Crabtree in the neck. Up flew the ink into the
instructor&rsquo;s face, covering his nose, chin and one
cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wretches!&rdquo; spluttered Crabtree, wiping
the ink from one eye. &ldquo;You wretches! Stop, or
I&rsquo;ll have you all locked up! This is&mdash;is disgraceful,
outrageous, preposterous! I never imagined
any set of boys could be so bad! I shall have
somebody arrested for assault and battery! I&rsquo;ll
have the law on all of you!&rdquo; And still brandishing
the ruler he ran from the classroom, banging
the door after him.</p>
<p>For the moment after he was gone nobody
spoke. Then Bart Conners emitted a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a how-do-you-do!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll try to have anybody arrested?&rdquo;
questioned Reff Ritter. He was just a
little scared and wished he had not thrown the
inkwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a job arresting the whole class,&rdquo;
was Andy&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t our fault,&rdquo; added Dale. &ldquo;He started
the trouble. It was his mistake about the lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; put in Dave Kearney. &ldquo;I knew
paragraph twenty-four, but he gave us only to the
end of twenty-two, I am certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added nearly every student present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, come to order!&rdquo; called out Jack.
&ldquo;Everybody take his books and sit down,&rdquo; and all
but Ritter did as requested. The latter took up
the fallen inkwell and carried it to his seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t fair to throw that inkwell,&rdquo; remarked
Joe Nelson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was going a little too far,&rdquo; said another
student.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Are you fellows going back on me?&rdquo;
demanded the bully, uneasily. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you throw
books and other things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books aren&rsquo;t inkwells full of ink,&rdquo; remarked
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You threw an apple core!&rdquo; flared back Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did&mdash;into the air. But it struck the blackboard,
not old Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; put in Coulter, bound to stand by
his crony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all in this together,&rdquo; said Paxton.
&ldquo;The fellow who tries to crawl ought to be
kicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d be the first to do it&mdash;if you could,&rdquo;
retorted Pepper. &ldquo;Just the same, nobody is
crawling yet,&rdquo; he added, quickly.</p>
<p>A warm discussion arose on all sides, and it
was generally admitted that, barring the inkwell
incident, Josiah Crabtree had gotten no more than
he deserved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be kicked out of this school,&rdquo;
said Henry Lee. &ldquo;We ought to combine and ask
Captain Putnam to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s under contract,&rdquo; said Bart Conners. &ldquo;If
the captain sent him away, old Crabtree would
most likely sue for his salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can do,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Sit
down and begin to study just as if nothing had
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he has gone for the authorities&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began one of the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll go. He&rsquo;ll have to wash that
ink off first&mdash;and the water will cool him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t dare to go, for we can complain
too,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened and Pluxton
Cuddle stalked in, followed by the gymnasium
instructor and Peleg Snuggers. The general
utility man carried a cane and looked troubled.
The new teacher marched to the platform and
the others did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This room will come to order!&rdquo; commanded
Pluxton Cuddle, but this order was unnecessary,
for every cadet was in his seat and all were sitting
up as stiff as ramrods. The silence was so complete
that the clock in the hall could be heard
ticking loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree informs me that a disgraceful
scene just occurred here,&rdquo; went on Pluxton Cuddle.
&ldquo;He was assaulted by books, inkwells and
other things. Were it not that he does not wish
to bring disgrace upon this institution of learning,
he would at once summon the authorities and
have all of you placed under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instructor paused, hoping somebody would
say something, but not a cadet opened his lips, although
all faced the teacher boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the names of all who threw anything
at Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; continued Pluxton Cuddle.
&ldquo;Everybody who threw anything stand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets looked at one another and nobody
budged from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I said, young gentlemen?&rdquo;
demanded the new teacher.</p>
<p>To this there was no reply. The students acted
as if they were images of stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call the roll!&rdquo; cried Pluxton Cuddle.
&ldquo;Snuggers, go to the door and see that no boy
leaves this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the general utility man,
and with shuffling steps he took up a position as
required.</p>
<p>There was a pause, as the new teacher got out
the roll book and began to scan the pages. Then,
of a sudden, the door opened once more and
Josiah Crabtree came in swiftly and marched to
the desk. In his hand he held a cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">PLUXTON CUDDLE&rsquo;S PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Jack, this begins to look serious,&rdquo; remarked
Pepper in a whisper, as all eyes were directed
to Crabtree and the lash he carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make a big mistake if he tries to whip
us,&rdquo; was the young major&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this?&rdquo; he asked, as a bit of paper was thrust into
his hand. The paper read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Refuse to say a word about anything. Pass
this paper along.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said the young major, and
slipped the sheet to the student behind him. Thus
the paper travelled from one end of the classroom
to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to call the roll, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo;
said Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out soon who
is guilty of assaulting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! The quicker the better,&rdquo; answered
the other teacher, grimly, and clutched his cat-o&rsquo;-nine
tails tightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he tries to use that there will be a regular
fight, mark my words,&rdquo; whispered Dale, who sat
near Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fool to bring that here, at such a time,&rdquo;
answered The Imp. &ldquo;What does he take us for,
a lot of kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Addison!&rdquo; called out Pluxton Cuddle, with his
eyes on the roll book. &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadet addressed did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you throw anything at Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you defy me?&rdquo; fumed Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>To this the pupil made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down! Blackmore, stand up. What have
you to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, Mr. Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You&mdash;er&mdash;Is this a plot, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, sir, excepting that I am
willing to go on with my lessons, Mr. Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no lessons here until this is settled!&rdquo;
cried Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Call the next
pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blossom! What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;
asked Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, sir,&rdquo; replied the first
lieutenant of Company A, in the same tone of
voice employed by those who had answered before
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is&mdash;a conspiracy!&rdquo; gasped Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you how it was!&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;I think the best thing I can do is to give
each pupil present ten lashes with this cat.&rdquo; And
he shook the cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails in the boys&rsquo; faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; called out Jack, rising. &ldquo;As
major of the school battalion I feel it my duty to
speak out. I think the boys would like me to be
their spokesman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; was the cry from all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we won&rsquo;t stand for a licking,&rdquo; said
one boy in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried the two teachers simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want justice!&rdquo; came from the middle of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to Captain Putnam!&rdquo; came from the
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it and go on with the lessons,&rdquo; added
a voice from the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; called out Jack and waved his hand.
&ldquo;Let me do the talking please.&rdquo; And at once the
classroom became silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, I want you to sit down!&rdquo; thundered
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be as well to listen to what
he has to say,&rdquo; whispered Pluxton Cuddle, who
was growing a little alarmed at the demonstration
the pupils seemed to be on the point of making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle, am I in authority here, or you?&rdquo;
demanded the unreasonable Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me to assist you, sir,&rdquo; answered
Cuddle, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, but&mdash;but&mdash;these young ruffians must
be taught to mind! The way they have acted is
outrageous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t gain much by bullying them,&rdquo; went
on Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;If I had my way, I know
what I&rsquo;d do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo; snapped Josiah
Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should cut down their supply of food. That
is the whole fault in this school&mdash;the boys get too
much to eat, sir, entirely too much. It makes
animals of them, yes, sir, animals!&rdquo; Pluxton
Cuddle was beginning to mount his hobby. &ldquo;I
have told Captain Putnam about it already. If
the boys had only half of what they get now
they would be brighter, quicker to learn, and much
more easy to manage. As it is, they get large
quantities of meat and it makes perfect bulls of
them&mdash;and the pastry clogs their brains, and they
can&rsquo;t learn their lessons even if they try. Put
them on half rations, and in less than a week you
will behold a wonderful change in them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; mused Josiah Crabtree, struck by a
sudden idea. &ldquo;It might be a good thing to cut
down their food&mdash;give them say one meal a day
until they got to their senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two small meals,&rdquo; interposed Pluxton Cuddle,
eagerly. &ldquo;And meat but once every forty-eight
hours&mdash;and no pastry of any kind. It
would do them a world of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do as you think best, Mr. Cuddle. You
have charge of them outside of the classrooms,
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you agree?&rdquo; questioned Pluxton Cuddle
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do as you please&mdash;I leave them entirely
in your hands, outside of the classrooms.
During school hours my word must be law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, I understand.&rdquo; Pluxton Cuddle began
rubbing his hands together. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start on
the new system of meals this very evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you like.&rdquo; Josiah Crabtree paused.
&ldquo;But I must finish what I started out to do.&rdquo; He
looked at Jack. &ldquo;Ruddy, since you seem so very
anxious to talk, what have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak for the whole class&mdash;or at
least for the majority of the boys,&rdquo; corrected the
young major, with a glance at Ritter, Coulter,
Paxton and Sabine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, out with it!&rdquo; snapped Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trouble, sir, is all due to a misunderstanding,&rdquo;
pursued the young major. &ldquo;We thought
you wanted us to study the Latin lesson up to
and including paragraph twenty-two. We were
not prepared to go any further than that, even
though Dave Kearney did get through all right.
We think the whole matter might be dropped
where it is&mdash;and we are willing to go back to
our studies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it!&rdquo; snapped Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Never!
If I do nothing more, I am going to thrash the
boy who threw that inkwell at me and covered
my face with ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this so fiercely that Reff Ritter grew
pale and looked around anxiously. The bully
wondered if the other cadets present would help
him to keep his secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the student who threw that inkwell to
stand up,&rdquo; went on the teacher, as Jack, having
had his way, sat down.</p>
<p>Nobody moved, although several pairs of eyes
were turned upon Reff Ritter. Many lads present
would have been glad to have seen the bully
punished, but they did not consider it honorable
to expose him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Crabtree had Pluxton Cuddle go through the
roll, but this gave the teachers no satisfaction.
Each and every cadet answered that he had nothing
to say.</p>
<p>After the last student had been questioned there
was another pause and an ominous silence. The
boys were curious to know what Josiah Crabtree
would do next. The teacher was in a quandary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take this up again another time,&rdquo; he
snapped, finally. &ldquo;You may return to your lessons,
and to-morrow we&rsquo;ll have for a Latin lesson
down to the end of paragraph thirty-two.
Do you understand?&mdash;down to the end of paragraph
thirty-two&mdash;not thirty or thirty-one, but
to the end of thirty-two.&rdquo; And then turning he
wrote the statement on the blackboard. &ldquo;Now
there will be no further misunderstanding,&rdquo; he
added sourly. Then he dismissed Peleg Snuggers
and the gymnastic instructor, put away the
cat-o&rsquo;-nine tails in his desk, and turned to talk
with Pluxton Cuddle in a whisper, so that the
scholars might not hear what was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! I wonder if he really expects us to
take such a long lesson?&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper in a
low voice. &ldquo;Why, from twenty-two to thirty-two
are ten paragraphs, and we never had over six
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to get square in one way if not
in another,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;ll
wager a lot of the fellows won&rsquo;t have the lesson
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Pluxton Cuddle hurried
out to another classroom, and then the routine for
the day went on as if nothing out of the ordinary
had happened. The cadets even saw Josiah Crabtree
smile to himself. It was a bad sign, and they
knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it in for us,&rdquo; whispered Dale. &ldquo;Look
out for a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a hurricane at that,&rdquo; returned Stuffer.</p>
<p>The classes were usually dismissed in the morning
at ten minutes to twelve, thus giving the cadets
ten minutes for exercise before sitting down to
dinner. But twelve o&rsquo;clock came and Josiah
Crabtree made no motion to dismiss the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, this is a new move,&rdquo; cried Pepper, in
a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence in the room,&rdquo; called out the teacher
sharply. &ldquo;We will now take up the lesson in
algebra. Conners, you may go to the blackboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat perplexed, Bart Conners arose and
walked to the board. He did not know the algebra
lesson very well, for he had counted on going
over it during the noon hour. He was given a
decidedly difficult problem in equations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is he going to keep us here all noon?&rdquo;
asked Hogan. &ldquo;Sure, if he is, &rsquo;tis an outrage, so
&rsquo;tis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t going to starve me!&rdquo; answered Stuffer,
who, as usual, was very hungry. He raised
his hand, and then, to get quicker recognition,
snapped his finger and thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singleton, what do you want?&rdquo; asked Josiah
Crabtree, tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, it&rsquo;s after twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we to go to dinner, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. Sit down.&rdquo; And the teacher
frowned heavily.</p>
<p>Stuffer sank into his seat, a look of misery on
his face. His appearance was so woe-begone
Pepper had to laugh outright. At this Crabtree
rapped sharply on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! I will have silence!&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;Conners, go on with the example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;do it,&rdquo; stammered the captain of
Company B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Then take your seat! Ritter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I am afraid I can&rsquo;t do it either.
I was going to study directly after dinner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the rest, Ritter. Paxton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I can do it,&rdquo; answered Nick Paxton,
and shuffled to the blackboard. He soon had a
mass of figures written down, but they seemed to
lead to nowhere, and Josiah Crabtree was more
put out than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all wrong, Paxton!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
are a blockhead! Take your seat!&rdquo; And Paxton
did so, with his head hanging down.</p>
<p>In the meantime the other classes had been dismissed,
and those kept in could hear the other
cadets walk through the halls and enter the mess
room. Then followed a clatter of knives and
forks and dishes. These sounds made many
cadets besides Stuffer feel an emptiness in the
vicinity of their belts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As no one appears to know the algebra lesson,
we will take time for studying,&rdquo; said Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;I will examine you again at one
o&rsquo;clock. The room will be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quarter of an hour dragged by slowly. The
boys wanted to talk the situation over, but Josiah
Crabtree would permit no whispering. Presently
the teacher arose and walked to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be back shortly,&rdquo; he said, in a cold
voice. &ldquo;I want absolute order maintained during
my absence.&rdquo; Then he went out, shutting the
door after him. A strange clicking followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has locked us in!&rdquo; exclaimed a youth who
sat near the door, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Now
what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">IN WHICH THE STORM GATHERS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he has gone off to get his own dinner,
and he is going to leave us starve!&rdquo; groaned Stuffer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stand it&mdash;no, sir!&rdquo; And
he jumped up from his desk and began to walk
around nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly a new move,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Captain Putnam or Mr. Strong
would do such a thing,&rdquo; vouchsafed Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, both of them are too considerate,&rdquo; answered
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the combined work of old Crabtree
and Cuddle,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;Cuddle loves
to cut a fellow short on grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack walked to the door and tried the knob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked, true enough,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the windows aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;I
could get out of a window almost as quick as out
of a door,&rdquo; he went on suggestively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all climb out and make a break for the
mess hall,&rdquo; cried Fred Century. &ldquo;He has no right
to cut us out of our dinner. It&rsquo;s paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; answered several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb out if anybody else will,&rdquo; said Reff
Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I!&rdquo; said Dale and Coulter in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows, if we make a move we
ought to have a regularly appointed leader,&rdquo; said
Dave Kearney. &ldquo;I move we make Major Ruddy
our leader. He&rsquo;s the commander of the battalion
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; came in a dozen voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with my leading?&rdquo; demanded
Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I made the suggestion to
climb out of the window, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;make Reff leader,&rdquo; put in Paxton,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just the fellow for the place,&rdquo; added
Coulter, while Sabine nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, give us Ruddy!&rdquo; called out a great
number of cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy! Ruddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, give Ritter a show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well put it to a vote,&rdquo; suggested
Dale, when cries were heard from all sides. &ldquo;All
in favor of Jack Ruddy for leader raise their
right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Instantly fifteen hands went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now those in favor of Reff Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight hands went up. The other cadets present
refused to vote at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy has it,&rdquo; announced Dale. &ldquo;Is
everybody satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; was the loud cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to be,&rdquo; grumbled Coulter.
&ldquo;But Ritter would have made a better leader.
He offered to go through the window, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind chewing it over now,&rdquo; broke in
Pepper. &ldquo;From now on, let Jack do the talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, are all in favor of leaving this room
and going to the mess hall?&rdquo; asked the young
major, mounting to the top of a desk and gazing
around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us get out of the windows, form
a company on the campus, and march into the
mess hall in regular soldier style. When we get
there, let every fellow take his usual place&mdash;and
refuse to budge until dinner is served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Stuffer.
&ldquo;And a full-sized dinner too, with dessert!&rdquo; he
added hastily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>For cadets used to gymnasium practice, it was
an easy matter to climb out of the classroom windows
to the campus. Once on the green, Jack lost
no time in forming the boys into a single company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;By column of
two, forward march!&rdquo; And he led the way, the
cadets following in pairs, and marching as stiffly
as if on dress parade.</p>
<p>It may be that somebody was on the watch, yet
the boys were not disturbed, and soon they filed
into the mess hall, where the other cadets were
just finishing their midday meal. At one table sat
Pluxton Cuddle and at another Josiah Crabtree.
Both leaped to their feet in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; gasped Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; For the moment he could
think of nothing else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it was past the dinner hour the class made
up its mind to come in and get something to
eat,&rdquo; said Jack, stiffly, and looking the teacher
full in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;rascal!&rdquo; exploded the teacher.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you to underst&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Crabtree, I am not a rascal,&rdquo;
interrupted Jack. &ldquo;I am the major of the Putnam
Hall battalion and the spokesman of our
class&mdash;so chosen by a vote of the cadets. We decided
that we wanted dinner&mdash;and we are here to
get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is mutiny&mdash;rebellion!&rdquo; gasped Pluxton
Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can call it what you please, Mr. Cuddle.
We are entitled to our dinner and we mean to
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Major Ruddy!&rdquo; came from a
pupil from another classroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree and Cuddle have no right to do you
out of your dinners,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make them give you what you pay for,&rdquo; added
a third.</p>
<p>The cries increased until it looked as if the
demonstration in the mess hall would be greater
than that which had occurred in the classroom.
Pluxton Cuddle called for order, but even as he
spoke a hot potato went sailing through the air
and hit him in the shirt front. Then a shower of
bread went up into the air, falling all around
both Cuddle and Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys! boys!&rdquo; gasped Josiah Crabtree, and
now he turned pale, wondering what would happen
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better give &rsquo;em something to eat, sah!&rdquo; suggested
the head waiter, a colored man. &ldquo;Some of
them hungry chaps look wicked, sah!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have all been fed too much, that is the
reason,&rdquo; said Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to-day,
I mean in general. However, perhaps it will
be as well, just now, to let them have a&mdash;er&mdash;a
light repast,&rdquo; he went on stammeringly, for another
hot potato had hit him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; called out Jack. &ldquo;Stop throwing
things. Mr. Crabtree wants to say something.&rdquo;
For he saw that the teacher wanted to speak to the
assemblage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I wish to state,&rdquo; began Josiah Crabtree,
when the cadets settled down at Jack&rsquo;s command,
&ldquo;that I&mdash;er&mdash;I did not intend to make
you do without your dinner. I was&mdash;er&mdash;going
to&mdash;er&mdash;let you come to the mess hall&mdash;er&mdash;after
the other pupils had finished. But as it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he gazed around somewhat helplessly, &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I
think you can stay. The waiters will bring in the
dinner.&rdquo; And he sat down and mopped his perspiring
forehead with his handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! I&rsquo;ll bet it was hard for him to come
down!&rdquo; whispered Dale to Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting afraid of the crowd,&rdquo; returned
The Imp. &ldquo;He was afraid we&rsquo;d pass him the stuff
on the table without waiting for plates!&rdquo; And
Pepper grinned suggestively.</p>
<p>The cadets had to wait a long time before they
were served. Meanwhile Pluxton Cuddle consulted
with the head waiter and paid a visit to the
kitchen. As a result, when the dinner came in,
the cadets found the food both scanty and exceedingly
plain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, how is a chap to get along on this,&rdquo;
growled Stuffer. &ldquo;I could eat twice as much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the best of it this time,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We
can hold a meeting after school and decide upon
what to do in the future&mdash;if things don&rsquo;t mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worst of it&mdash;to Stuffer&rsquo;s mind&mdash;was that
there was nothing but a little rice pudding for
dessert. All of the cadets who had rebelled went
from the mess room hungry&mdash;and out on the campus
they discovered that the other cadets had
fared little better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cuddle&rsquo;s doings,&rdquo; said one of the other
students. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crank on the question of eating&mdash;thinks
a man ought to eat next to nothing
to be healthy and clear-minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree was willing enough to fall in with
his views,&rdquo; returned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he wanted to square up with
you. Personally, Crabtree likes to eat as hearty
a meal as anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we are coming to, if Captain
Putnam or Mr. Strong don&rsquo;t come back
soon,&rdquo; said another cadet. &ldquo;We had a row in our
classroom too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither Crabtree nor Cuddle are fit to manage
a school,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;They may be good
enough teachers, but they need somebody in authority
over them.&rdquo; And this statement hit the
nail squarely on the head.</p>
<p>Reff Ritter was still disturbed, thinking that
Crabtree might find out that he was guilty of
throwing the inkwell, and he went around,
&ldquo;sounding&rdquo; various cadets and getting them to
promise not to mention the matter. He was chagrined
to think that he had not been chosen
leader in the rebellion, and was half inclined to
draw away from Jack&rsquo;s friends and form a party
of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy wants to lead in everything,&rdquo; he
growled to Coulter. &ldquo;It makes me sick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t afford to go back on him
now,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;If you do he may take
it in his head to let old Crabtree know about the
inkwell, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he can lead if he wants the job so bad,&rdquo;
interrupted the bully hastily.</p>
<p>At the proper time the bell rang for the afternoon
session and all of the cadets marched to
their various classrooms as if nothing out of the
ordinary had occurred. Lessons were taken up
where they had been dropped, but the boys found
it hard to concentrate their minds on what they
were studying or reciting. All felt that a storm&mdash;and
a big one at that&mdash;was brewing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Josiah Crabtree did not come into the classroom
occupied by Jack and his chums, and Reff
Ritter and his crowd. Instead he sent an under
teacher, a meek man who did just what he was
told, no more and no less. With this teacher the
boys got along very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could have him right along,&rdquo; observed
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did have him you wouldn&rsquo;t make much
progress,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good enough
for the lower classes, but that&rsquo;s all. He doesn&rsquo;t
know half as much as Mr. Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the cadets were dismissed for the day
they hurried out on the campus, and here Jack
asked all who were interested in what had occurred
to attend a meeting at the boathouse. About
three-quarters of the cadets responded, those
holding back being the smaller lads and a few
timid ones like Mumps.</p>
<p>At this meeting it came out that every class
in the school had &ldquo;caught it,&rdquo; either from Josiah
Crabtree or Pluxton Cuddle. Sharp words and
almost blows had been exchanged in the classrooms,
and every cadet had some fault to find
with the food served for dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cuddle not only wants to cut down the
amount, but he wants the meats and other things
cooked in a peculiar way,&rdquo; said one cadet. &ldquo;I
have always been used to a good table and I am
not going to stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will I!&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;Our parents pay
for good board&mdash;and that means three square
meals a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand Captain Putnam and Mr.
Strong expect to be away for at least ten days,&rdquo;
said Henry Lee. &ldquo;I am not going to starve myself
for that length of time, even to please Crabtree
and Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say!&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are certainly entitled to as good a table
as we have been having,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if we don&rsquo;t get it, let&rsquo;s strike!&rdquo; cried
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">WORDS AND BLOWS</span></h2>
<p>The meeting at the boathouse lasted for nearly
an hour, yet no definite conclusion was reached.
Some of the boys wanted to wait and see what
developed, while others were for taking the most
drastic action immediately. At last it was voted
to wait, and to leave the matter of what was to be
done in the hands of a committee of five, of
which Jack was the chairman. The other four
members of this committee were Pepper, Dale,
Bart Conners and a cadet named Barringer, a
youth who had the distinction of being the first
cadet enrolled at the Hall, and whose folks were
warm personal friends of Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure if we act with care and fairness
Captain Putnam will uphold us,&rdquo; said Frank Barringer.
&ldquo;But there must be no rowdyism. If
there is I shall withdraw from the committee and
from whatever is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not favor rowdyism,&rdquo; answered the
young major. &ldquo;But neither shall I allow Crabtree
or Cuddle to walk over us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I agree on that, Major Ruddy. Both of
those teachers have been far too dictatorial. But
it was a mistake to throw potatoes and bread
around the dining room, and it was vile to throw
an inkwell at Crabtree,&rdquo; added Frank Barringer.</p>
<p>During the afternoon Josiah Crabtree drove to
Cedarville in Captain Putnam&rsquo;s coach. When he
returned he had with him three men, burly individuals
who looked like dock hands&mdash;and such
they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those men going to do here?&rdquo; asked
Andy of his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;If they
were going to do some work they wouldn&rsquo;t come
at this time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see if Peleg Snuggers knows anything
about it,&rdquo; suggested Dale, and he and the others
walked down to the barn, where they found the
general utility man putting up the team the
teacher had used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to help me, young gents?&rdquo; asked Snuggers,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peleg, we want to know what those three men
came for?&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The general utility man shrugged his
shoulders. &ldquo;Better go an&rsquo; ask Mr. Crabtree&mdash;he
brung &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;brung,&rsquo; Peleg,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad geography. You ought to say bringed
or brang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I ain&rsquo;t never had much
schoolin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the reply, as the man scratched
his head. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he went on, with a grin, &ldquo;you
had high jinks this mornin&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t you? I
wanted to laff right out, but I didn&rsquo;t dast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those men going to work here, Peleg?&rdquo;
demanded Jack, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Mr. Crabtree? He brung&mdash;no,
bringed, no brang &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they here to keep the peace?&rdquo; asked Andy,
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree said as how I wasn&rsquo;t to say
nuthin&rsquo; about it,&rdquo; stammered the general utility
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he brought them here for that purpose?&rdquo;
demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but don&rsquo;t let on as how I told ye!&rdquo;
whispered Peleg Snuggers. &ldquo;He an&rsquo; Cuddle got
scart, I reckon, and Crabtree said he was goin&rsquo;
to git some special policemen to keep the peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t the limit!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing you know he&rsquo;ll be marching
the whole school down to the Cedarville lock-up,&rdquo;
came from Dale. &ldquo;That is&mdash;if he can!&rdquo; he added
significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now please don&rsquo;t let on I said a word about
it!&rdquo; pleaded Peleg Snuggers. &ldquo;If ye do it may
cost me my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t utter a syllable,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;Remember that, fellows,&rdquo; he added, and the
others nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree is awful mad,&rdquo; went on the man of
all work. &ldquo;He an&rsquo; that new teacher have got
it in for all of ye! Better watch out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Pepper; and then he and his
chums walked away.</p>
<p>It was now time for the afternoon dress parade,
and the cadets had to hurry to get ready.
Soon the drum sounded out and the cadets gathered
on the campus. Jack got his sword and
took command, and put the boys through a drill
that would have done any army officer good to
behold. Only a few boys, like Ritter, Coulter
and Paxton took advantage of the fact that Captain
Putnam was absent, and to these the young
major and the other officers paid scant attention.
Ritter hoped he would be &ldquo;called down,&rdquo; so that
he might have a chance to answer back, and it
made him sour when this opportunity was denied
to him.</p>
<p>It was whispered around what the three Cedarville
men had been brought for, and loud were
the denunciations of Josiah Crabtree in consequence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to give Putnam Hall a black eye,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;If he was a gentleman he would
let us settle this matter among ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those men try to do anything I fancy there
will be a pitched battle,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>As was the custom, Jack marched the battalion
around the grounds and then into the mess hall,
and here all sat down to the tables for supper.
They saw the three strange men sitting at a side
table, in company with the gymnastic instructor,
and near at hand were half a dozen heavy carriage
whips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, did you notice the men and the whips?&rdquo;
questioned Pepper, in a low, excited voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;and I think Crabtree and Cuddle are
crazy,&rdquo; was the equally low response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen!&rdquo; called out Josiah Crabtree,
from his place at the head of a table. &ldquo;This
noon we had a most outrageous scene enacted
here. Such a scene must not be repeated. We
must have order&mdash;no matter what the cost.&rdquo; And
he allowed his eyes to wander toward the three
strange men and the gymnastic instructor and
then to the whips.</p>
<p>No more was said, and the waiters began to
bring in the food. There was bread and butter,
some very thin slices of cold roast beef, tea,
and some exceedingly small pieces of plain cake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a supper!&rdquo; murmured Pepper. &ldquo;Does
he take us for fairies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat three times as much as this,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;Poor Stuffer, this will just about
finish him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage!&rdquo; cried Dale, but in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; The call came from Stuffer,
who had arisen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Singleton?&rdquo; snapped the
teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want more to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all you are going to have. Sit
down, or else leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hungry, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys all eat too much,&rdquo; interposed
Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;Hereafter you are to have
what is proper for you and no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I am hungry,&rdquo; insisted Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, or leave!&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some more too,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; added Henry Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are entitled to more,&rdquo; came from Dave
Kearney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our folks pay for it,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be quiet,&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle and I know what is best for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; called out Jack, getting up.
&ldquo;In the name of this school I demand that you
listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in a full, ringing voice that penetrated
every corner of the dining hall. Instantly
every eye was fastened on the youthful major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy!&rdquo; gasped the teacher. &ldquo;How dare
you talk to me in this fashion! Sit down! Sit
down instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I have had my say. Mr. Crabtree,
the cadets of this school had a meeting this afternoon,
and we resolved to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, sit down and be quiet, or I&rsquo;ll have
you put out!&rdquo; burst out Josiah Crabtree, purple
in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We resolved that we would not stand this
treatment any longer. A committee was formed,
of which I have the honor to be chairman. This
committee is willing to have a conference with
you and Mr. Cuddle, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack got no further, for, wild with rage,
Josiah Crabtree had motioned to two of the
strange men and these fellows now came forward,
each with a whip in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike Ruddy!&rdquo; called out Pepper. &ldquo;If
you do, you&rsquo;ll rue it!&rdquo; And he caught up a plate
from the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Put those whips down!&rdquo; came from a dozen
boys, and on the instant the mess hall was in an
uproar. Nearly every cadet armed himself with
a plate, cup or saucer.</p>
<p>The strange men who had come close to Jack
halted, and then slunk back. They saw that the
cadets &ldquo;meant business&rdquo; and as a consequence
they were afraid to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, keep quiet!&rdquo; called out Jack, in the
midst of the din, and when the tumult had somewhat
subsided, he went on: &ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, do
not go too far, or the consequences will be on
your own head. We are willing to do what is
fair and just. But you must treat us fair and
just, too, and we want the same kind of food,
and the same quantity, that we had when Captain
Putnam was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ask one question,&rdquo; put in
Frank Barringer. &ldquo;Did Captain Putnam authorize
anybody to cut down our food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He authorized Mr. Crabtree and myself to
manage the school,&rdquo; snapped Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t answering the question,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Did the captain say anything at all about the
food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not on the witness stand,&rdquo; snarled Cuddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to manage this institution as we
deem best,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;I command
every student present to put down the dish he is
holding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make those men retire and put down
the whips,&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;Take the men and
the whips away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the tumult arose, and in the midst of
the uproar a plate whizzed through the air and
struck Pluxton Cuddle on the shoulder, causing
him to utter a cry of pain and alarm. Then a
saucer landed on Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>When the first plate was thrown the men with
the whips sprang forward, and in a twinkling
half a dozen cadets felt the keen lashes. But
then came more dishes, and one man was hit on
the nose and another on the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! we can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo; called one of the
men. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be killed! Come on!&rdquo; And dodging
a sugar bowl, he ran out of a side door,
and the other men, including the gymnasium instructor,
followed him. Then, shaking his fist
at the students, Josiah Crabtree backed out also,
and Pluxton Cuddle followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We have vanquished the enemy!&rdquo;
cried Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, stop that plate throwing!&rdquo; called out
Jack. And then gradually the excitement died
down. Only the cadets and the waiters were left
in the mess room. The waiters were so scared
and perplexed they did not know what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have some more eating,&rdquo; exclaimed
Stuffer. &ldquo;We may not get another chance like
this in a hurry.&rdquo; And he gave a waiter an order
to fill. Then came more orders, and the waiters
went off, grinning from ear to ear, for at heart
they sided with the students.</p>
<p>While waiting for more food the cadets talked
the situation over from every possible point of
view. Many condemned the plate throwing,
which had been started by Ritter and Coulter.
Yet all were glad that the men with horsewhips
had been routed. What to do next was a question
nobody was able to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one thing we ought to do,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Telegraph to Captain Putnam to come back at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;Do it before old
Crabtree sends a message. That will show the
captain we are not afraid to leave the case to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get his address first,&rdquo; said
Henry Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; answered Frank Barringer, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll send him a telegram to-night. But I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;ll be able to get back here inside of
several days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">PRISONERS IN THE DORMITORIES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing is certain,&rdquo; observed Pepper,
as he and half a dozen others left the mess
hall. &ldquo;We are getting into this thing deeper
and deeper. I wonder how it is going to end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if it ends before Captain Putnam gets
back,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Crabtree is just headstrong
enough to attempt something even worse
than getting men with whips. Maybe he&rsquo;ll have
all of us locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you stand for being arrested, Jack?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree is a fool!&rdquo; burst out Henry
Lee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give half my spending money to ship
him to&mdash;to Africa or the North Pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; burst out Stuffer.
&ldquo;Why not send him a bogus telegram, saying
his grandfather or second cousin is dying of
brainstorm, or something like that, and ask him
to come right on? That might take him away
until the captain got back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might try that,&rdquo; mused Jack. &ldquo;But let
us see first what happens to-morrow. Maybe by
morning Crabtree and Cuddle will cool off&mdash;and
perhaps the fellows will cool off too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What had become of the teachers and the
strange men none of the cadets knew, and the
absence of all made the boys worry somewhat,
although they tried not to show it. They wondered
if the teachers had really gone off to summon
more help, or make a formal complaint to
the authorities. There was very little playing or
studying done that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well go to bed,&rdquo; said Pepper, when
the usual time for retiring was at hand. &ldquo;I must
say, I am dead tired. Such strenuous times are
too much for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one the cadets went to their various
dormitories. A few were inclined to &ldquo;cut up,&rdquo;
but Jack soon stopped this in every room but that
occupied by Reff Ritter and his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to be on your good behavior,&rdquo;
said the young major. &ldquo;Remember, when Captain
Putnam gets back I am going to give him
a full and true report of what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to say anything to him about
inkwells and plates,&rdquo; growled Ritter. &ldquo;If you
do you&rsquo;ll get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect every student to confess to just what
was done,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock the majority of the cadets went
to bed, and an hour later the Hall was wrapped
in stillness. Then, from the barn, there came
a number of strange men, Josiah Crabtree and
Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now make no noise,&rdquo; cautioned Crabtree.
&ldquo;If you do some of them may wake up and make
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; answered one of the strange
men, who appeared to be something of a leader.
Then the whole party entered the school building
by a back door, and went about carrying out
a plan they had arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Pepper, as he woke up in the
morning and looked at his watch. &ldquo;Half-past
seven! I didn&rsquo;t hear any bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; came from Andy, who sat
up at the same time. &ldquo;I fancy it didn&rsquo;t ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is going wrong in this school,&rdquo;
put in the young major, as he slipped out of
bed and commenced to dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe old Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle, Esquire,
have given it up,&rdquo; suggested Pepper, as
he rubbed his eyes and yawned.</p>
<p>Jack was the first to be dressed and Andy
quickly followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take a look around and see how the
land lays,&rdquo; suggested the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; responded the acrobatic youth
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware of traps!&rdquo; sang out Pepper. &ldquo;Crabtree
may be waiting for you with a club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a shotgun,&rdquo; added Dale, with a grin.</p>
<p>Jack walked to the door and turned the knob.
To his surprise the door refused to open. He
tried to shake it, but it remained firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jack stooped down and looked into
the keyhole. &ldquo;The key is on the outside,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps somebody is playing a trick on us,&rdquo;
suggested Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Crabtree and Cuddle,&rdquo; murmured the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try the door to the next room,&rdquo; suggested
Andy.</p>
<p>Several of the dormitories were connected by
side doors, and hurried into the next room, Andy
tried the door leading to the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is locked too!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re locked in, that is all there is to it!&rdquo;
cried one of the cadets. &ldquo;The enemy has locked
us in while we slept!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a new idea for bringing us to
terms,&rdquo; said Stuffer. &ldquo;Wonder how long Crabtree
and Cuddle expect to keep us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long enough to make you go without your
breakfast, Stuffer,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a grin.
&ldquo;Not much! I&rsquo;ll break down the door first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t break down no door!&rdquo; cried a
harsh voice from the outer side of the barrier.
&ldquo;If you try it, you&rsquo;ll get hurt, remember that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded Andy, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man hired to watch this door, and I
am going to do it. Don&rsquo;t you try no funny work,
or you&rsquo;ll get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you one of the fellows who was in the
mess hall yesterday?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been hired by Mr. Crabtree and
Mr. Cuddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t none of your business,&rdquo; answered
the strange man, roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my business,&rdquo; returned the young major,
warmly. &ldquo;You send for Mr. Crabtree at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-going to do it. I was told to stay
here and watch these doors. Now you jest keep
quiet and mind your own business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we break down the door?&rdquo; asked
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first boy who tries it, will get a good
licking, and he&rsquo;ll be tied up in the coal cellar in
the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; asked Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I ain&rsquo;t! There are ten of us
here and outside, and we are actin&rsquo; under orders
from the teachers. They are going to show you
that you can&rsquo;t run this school during Captain
Putnam&rsquo;s absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he is telling the truth?&rdquo; whispered
the young major to his chums. &ldquo;Ten of
them! It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I take a look out of a window,&rdquo;
said Dale, and ran to the nearest opening. He
poked out his head and looked down on the campus.
&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; asked several in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three men down there, and they are armed
with clubs and guns!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; burst out Jack, and ran forward to
take a look himself. Soon every window was
crowded with cadets, all gazing down to the
ground below. There were three strange men,
including one of those who had been in the
mess hall the evening previous. As Dale had
said, each had a club in one hand and a gun in
the other. They walked up and down the side
of the building, every once in a while glancing
upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the limit!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Why,
you&rsquo;d think we were prisoners in a penitentiary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and some of those men were the keepers,&rdquo;
added Andy. &ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;let us give them something to let them know
we are awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; cried Pepper, quick to catch
on to a joke. &ldquo;Everybody hand them a souvenir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment more each cadet present in the
two rooms had armed himself. One had a cake
of soap, another an old pair of shoes, another a
pitcher of water, and the rest old books and odds
and ends of various kinds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, all together!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;One,
two, three!&rdquo; And
<a id="rfront" href="#front">down went the miscellaneous collection</a>
on the heads of the guards. Yells of
pain and wonder arose, for each of the men was
struck. Before the guards could recover from
the unexpected attack, each cadet withdrew from
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you! We&rsquo;ll get square, see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
yelled one of the men. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you attempt to
git out o&rsquo; them windows or you&rsquo;ll git shot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;d attempt to shoot us?&rdquo;
asked one of the boys, in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; answered Jack,
and his tone was very grave. He realized that
the situation had become a truly serious one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">ANDY SNOW&rsquo;S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Leaving the windows, the cadets went back to
the doors leading to the hallway. They again
called up the man on guard there and asked for
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must speak to him,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;And if
you won&rsquo;t call him we&rsquo;ll all rush the doors, break
them down, and&mdash;well, you know what to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the man wanted to argue again, but
presently he became frightened and blew a
whistle he carried. Then the cadets heard footsteps
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; came in Josiah Crabtree&rsquo;s
sharp voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want to talk to you,&rdquo; answered the
guard doggedly. &ldquo;Said they&rsquo;d break down the
doors if I didn&rsquo;t call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not dare to do it!&rdquo; cried the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we will dare!&rdquo; shouted several of the
boys who heard the remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
demanded Jack, in a loud, clear voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that I am going to keep you in your
rooms until you learn how to behave yourselves,&rdquo;
was the cold answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have something to eat when you
come downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us come down now,&rdquo; put in Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cadet shall leave these rooms until he
has apologized to Mr. Cuddle and myself and
given his word of honor that he will in the future
do precisely as he is told,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree,
in the overbearing, dictatorial tone he so
often employed in the classroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologize!&rdquo; gasped a number of the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not apologize!&rdquo; murmured Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in a year of Mondays,&rdquo; added Dale. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know that I did anything to apologize for.
He and Cuddle started the row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I demand my breakfast!&rdquo; cried
Stuffer. &ldquo;I am entitled to it&mdash;my folks have paid
for it&mdash;and I am not going to let you swindle
me out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swindle you!&rdquo; gasped the teacher, in a rage.
&ldquo;Such language! To me! me! Ha! boy, wait
till I get my hands on you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I think you&rsquo;ll find it best to let
us out and give us our breakfast,&rdquo; continued the
young major. &ldquo;You certainly can&rsquo;t intend to
starve us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do intend to starve you, until you come
to your senses,&rdquo; said another voice in the hallway.
It was Pluxton Cuddle who had come up.
&ldquo;As I have said many times, you eat too much
and it has made you saucy, impudent and unreasonable.
An empty stomach may bring you to
your senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may make us desperate,&rdquo; murmured Stuffer.
&ldquo;I am not going to let anybody starve me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this talk there had been considerable
pounding on the doors of various other dormitories.
Evidently the great majority of the cadets
were held prisoners in their rooms. Now Josiah
Crabtree went off to talk at another door, and
was followed by the new teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I want you to come to order!&rdquo; called
out Jack, to the cadets of the two rooms that
adjoined each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to hand around sandwiches?&rdquo; questioned
Stuffer, dolefully. &ldquo;If you are, give me
about six!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up your belt, Stuffer,&rdquo; was the answer,
with a smile. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get breakfast to-day
you may get it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have breakfast to-day&mdash;or pull down the
Hall!&rdquo; said the youth who loved to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is, What are we going to do?&rdquo;
said Jack, in a loud voice. &ldquo;Mr. Crabtree wants
us to apologize and promise to do exactly as we
are told in the future. What have you to say
to his proposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No promises to do just whatever he wants,&rdquo;
added Dale. &ldquo;He is too unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him we are willing to return to our lessons
and behave ourselves,&rdquo; said Bart Conners.
&ldquo;And add that we are willing to leave the question
of punishment for what has happened to
Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; said several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he won&rsquo;t give in, sure, we can break
down the dures, bedad!&rdquo; came from Emerald.
&ldquo;We can have a regular Donnybrook Fair time,
so we can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If possible we ought to keep from further
quarrels,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let us arbitrate if it can
possibly be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>So it was finally decided, and again Josiah
Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle were called to one
of the doors of the two rooms. In a calm voice
Jack explained to the teachers and pleaded that
the whole matter be allowed to rest until Captain
Putnam&rsquo;s return. He said he would vouch
for it that the boys would go back to their studies
just as if nothing out of the ordinary had
happened. He added, that he thought it was a
disgrace to bring the strange men to the Hall
as guards and he asked that they be dismissed.</p>
<p>It was with difficulty that Josiah Crabtree and
Pluxton Cuddle could be made to listen. The
two instructors had talked the matter over between
them, and the unreasonableness of the one
was bolstered up by the other. They refused to
listen to any argument, and stuck by the proposition
Josiah Crabtree had first laid down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not a mouthful of food shall any cadet
have until he does as we demand,&rdquo; said Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you try to break out you&rsquo;ll do it at
your peril,&rdquo; added Pluxton Cuddle. And then
the two teachers gave the guards in the hallways
some instructions in whispers, and went below
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>It would be hard to define the feelings of the
cadets when they were left alone once more.
Some wanted to break down the doors at once,
while others spoke of climbing out of the windows,
using knotted-together bedsheets for that
purpose. Still others advised waiting to see
what might turn up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can all do without our breakfast,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;And we can go without dinner, too, if
we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; groaned Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think old Crabtree wants us to break down
the doors and do as much damage to the building
as possible,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be able
to prove to Captain Putnam what a lot of ruffians
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are right,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;I
agree with Jack, let us go slow and see what
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how Reff Ritter and his crowd are
taking it,&rdquo; said Henry Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter won&rsquo;t want to go without his breakfast,&rdquo;
answered Andy. &ldquo;He is the greatest
feeder in the school. He eats even more than
Stuffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter can eat his share, too,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter is responsible for a good deal of this
trouble,&rdquo; went on Dave Kearney. &ldquo;He made old
Crabtree boiling mad by throwing the inkwell,
and he started the throwing of things in the
mess room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>It was a dreary wait in the dormitories, and
the majority of the boys did not know what to do
with themselves. Joe Nelson started to study
but soon gave it up. One lad had some dominoes
and several cadets played a dozen games or more.</p>
<p>While this was going on Jack walked around
the two rooms and looked into the various clothing
closets. Presently an idea struck him and
he called Andy to his side. The two entered one
of the closets, and the acrobatic youth got up on
a shelf and pulled loose a board of the ceiling.
Then he wormed his way through the opening
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Andy doing?&rdquo; asked Pepper, coming
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I remembered the board ceiling in this
closet,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I wondered what was
above it. Andy is such a gymnast I sent him
up to investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so dark beyond the hole that little or
nothing could be seen. Andy was gone over
quarter of an hour. Then his head appeared and
he called softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have you discovered anything?&rdquo; asked
the young major, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I discovered anything? Well, I just
guess yes!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made the greatest
discovery of the century!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, take these bags first. I would have
brought more, only I couldn&rsquo;t carry them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, to the amazement of the cadets who
assembled in the clothing closet and near the
doorway, the acrobatic youth passed down four
large paper bags, each filled with something to
eat. Then he came down himself, closing the
opening in the ceiling after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, Jack, where does the hole lead to?&rdquo;
asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hole leads to one end of the trunk
room,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The door to the trunk
room was unlocked, and from there I passed to
a back hallway and down a back stairs
to the kitchen and pantry. Fellows, we&rsquo;ve
got Crabtree and Cuddle beaten a mile!
We can get all the grub we want&mdash;and have our
liberty too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">ON A FORAGING EXPEDITION</span></h2>
<p>The announcement that Andy made was received
with keen interest by all. Every cadet
crowded around to get some of the food brought
in and to learn the particulars of his foraging
and exploring expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting down the back stairs was easy,&rdquo; said
the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;But once I was in the
lower entryway I had to keep my eyes open,
to escape the cook and the waiters. I found the
bags on a hook behind the door and I got the
grub from the pantry when nobody was near.
I was careful what I took, for I didn&rsquo;t want
anybody to discover what had been done. I may
want to go back for dinner, you know,&rdquo; and
Andy grinned broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, you have saved my life!&rdquo; cried Stuffer,
with his mouth full of bread and cheese.
&ldquo;I shall remember you in my will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave some for me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I am
just as hungry as anybody. All I had in the
pantry was one cold sausage and a cracker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, we&rsquo;ll divide the stuff equally,&rdquo; said
Jack, and this was done. Fortunately the paper
bags held quite some food, so there was more
than enough for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we can&rsquo;t get some of this stuff to
the fellows in the next dormitory,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;I suppose they are as hungry as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;Put all your
contributions for the next room into this bag,&rdquo;
and he held up the receptacle as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to get it to them?&rdquo; questioned
Henry Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a brand new, patented and copyrighted
way,&rdquo; went on Dale. &ldquo;Just fork over, everybody,
for the benefit of the heathens in Hungry
Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bag was soon filled with bread, cheese,
crackers and chipped beef, and then Dale tied it
fast to the end of a hockey stick. This done, he
went to one of the windows and looked out cautiously.
Not one of the guards below was looking
up. He shoved the bag outside and swung
it to the left as far as possible&mdash;directly in front
of another window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; a voice cried, and then
the bag was caught and taken in. Then the
head of a cadet appeared. &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; he
said to Dale. &ldquo;Just what we were wishing for.
How did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;Maybe, if
you keep mum, there will be more coming later.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Are you fellows going to give in?&rdquo; went on
the cadet from the next dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what we&rsquo;ve decided. We&rsquo;ve got a plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are kept here until to-night we are
going to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be with you,&rdquo; answered Dale,
and then, as a guard looked up, he drew in his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea, Dale,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;By
means of the windows we can communicate with
every dormitory on this side of the building.
Queer we didn&rsquo;t think of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were too much upset by the talk with
Cuddle and Crabtree,&rdquo; answered Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pass along some notes and see how
the different rooms feel over this affair,&rdquo; continued
the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Soon the notes were written, each having on it
the number of the dormitory for which it was
intended. Then the communications were pinned
to the hockey stick, and by this means passed
from one room window to the next. Thus five
rooms were reached, and soon notes began to
come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are certainly of one mind,&rdquo; said Jack,
after the various communications had been read.
&ldquo;Everybody says, &lsquo;No surrender!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s plain
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barringer&rsquo;s room is giving out apples,&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so bad. I shouldn&rsquo;t mind an
apple myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all waiting for food, and I suppose
it is up to us to supply them with some,&rdquo; continued
Jack. &ldquo;I have half a mind to go down
myself and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; put in Pepper. &ldquo;I am
tired of being boxed in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be careful, or you&rsquo;ll give the snap
away,&rdquo; cautioned Andy. &ldquo;Some of the steps of
the back stairs squeak terribly. I left my shoes
in the trunk room when I went down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave them here,&rdquo; answered The Imp,
and took off the footwear then and there, and
Jack did likewise.</p>
<p>It was no easy thing to climb through the
ceiling opening into the trunk room, and once
above they had to feel their way through the
darkness to the door. Pepper stubbed his toe
on a trunk and drew a sharp breath of pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I put an awful dent in the trunk,&rdquo;
was the joking reply. &ldquo;Let us get a candle when
we go down. I hate this darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With bated breath the two cadets walked out
into the deserted hall and then down the back
stairs. Once they heard somebody close at hand
slam a door and their hearts leaped into their
throats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody sees us, run like mad for the
trunk room and fasten the door somehow,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a soul to know what
we are up to. If we can get food we can stand
Cuddle and Crabtree off indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the boys reached the back entryway,
and through a crack of the door peered into the
kitchen. Nobody was present, and the big pantry
was also deserted, and so was the mess hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it all to ourselves!&rdquo; whispered
Pepper joyfully. &ldquo;Jack, this is a cinch, a picnic!
Let us take up all the food we can carry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is just what we want,&rdquo; replied the major,
and took from a hook two big waiters&rsquo;
aprons. &ldquo;We can bundle up a lot of stuff in
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here are two fresh tins of crackers, ten
pounds in each tin. We must take these by all
means&mdash;and that fresh chunk of cheese!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;You take what you can carry to the trunk
room,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hunt up something
a little more appetizing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Pepper was on his errand the young
major made a careful survey of the pantry, and
into a wooden box he found there placed a freshly-boiled
ham, some cold roast beef, several
loaves of bread, some butter, three bottles of
pickles, some cans of sardines and some bottles
of milk. Then, from a barrel, he filled a wash
basin with apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will do for the present, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo;
he said, as he surveyed the stuff. &ldquo;Now for a
candle and some matches,&rdquo; and he procured them.</p>
<p>He carried the wooden box on his shoulder and
Pepper came down and got the apples, and also
two loaf cakes which had been baked the day
before, and some knives, forks and several
glasses and tin plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think we were getting ready for the
annual encampment,&rdquo; said The Imp, while he
and Jack were on the way upstairs with the last
of the things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed the young major, suddenly.
&ldquo;Somebody is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the cook!&rdquo; gasped Pepper, as he caught
sight of a well-known figure coming along the
upper hallway. &ldquo;Jack, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know! We&rsquo;ll have to run past
her, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it&mdash;the hall is too narrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook came closer, and the two cadets
turned back and tried to crouch out of sight in
a doorway. The boys&rsquo; hearts were, figuratively
speaking, in their throats.</p>
<p>But just as the cook was almost on them she
paused and turned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I meant to bring that clean apron
down!&rdquo; the cadets heard her murmur, and then
she passed out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lucky escape,&rdquo; gasped Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop any longer&mdash;get up to the trunk
room before it is too late,&rdquo; urged his chum, and
together they sped on as if a ghost was at their
heels. Having arrived there they shut the door
and pulled a trunk in front of it, first, however,
lighting the candle, that they might not break
anything.</p>
<p>It took some time to transfer all the food to
the dormitory below. The quantity made all the
boys smile, and Stuffer&rsquo;s eyes fairly glistened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the best yet,&rdquo; said the youth who
loved to eat. &ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t it most dinner time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Bob Grenwood was in this room,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d appoint him quartermaster once more&mdash;to
divide the rations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make me quartermaster,&rdquo; pleaded Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be sure to look out for No. 1!&rdquo; said
Fred, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This food is to be divided among all the
rooms we can reach,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;And it is to
be a fair division, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The division then commenced, and for the best
part of an hour the cadets were busy, passing
stuff from one window to another. They had to
do this with care, so that none of the guards
on the campus might discover what was going
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for dinner!&rdquo; cried Pepper, as he
looked at his watch and saw that it was twelve
o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;Boys, I think we can all be truly thankful
for the good things provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we can,&rdquo; answered Dale.</p>
<p>At that moment there sounded footsteps in the
hallway and then came a knock on the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED TO JACK RUDDY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, get the eating out of sight&mdash;somebody
may want to come in!&rdquo; cried Jack, in a low voice.
And in a few seconds the food was placed in a
closet and covered with papers and books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you!&rdquo; called the voice of
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo; demanded
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; went on the teacher.
&ldquo;Dinner will be served in a few minutes. Are
you ready to do as I wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean for us to apologize?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to promise to do as ordered in the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; answered several, in
unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want your dinner?&rdquo; demanded the
teacher, in a somewhat crestfallen tone of voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a question of dinner&mdash;it is a question
of principle, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&mdash;but you must be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; and this was true, for nobody had
as yet started to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use of your being stubborn,&rdquo;
continued Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not stubborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the one who is stubborn,&rdquo; put in
Dale. &ldquo;You and Mr. Cuddle think you are
right&mdash;but we are about thirty or thirty-five to
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! you are only boys and do not realize
what you are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to leave this matter to Captain
Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t want any dinner, eh?&rdquo; Josiah
Crabtree felt certain that the cadets must be very
hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your terms,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you all say that?&rdquo; called out the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, you can go hungry a while longer!&rdquo;
cried Crabtree in a rage, and stalked off
to interview the boys in some of the other rooms.
One and all refused to &ldquo;surrender,&rdquo; as they expressed
it. Then Josiah Crabtree went below to
the office, where he met Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as yet not hungry enough,&rdquo; said
Cuddle, after listening to the other teacher&rsquo;s story.
&ldquo;Wait until the middle of the afternoon, or supper
time. I&rsquo;ll warrant they will then be glad
enough to do anything we wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; answered Josiah Crabtree,
and then he and Cuddle talked the matter over
from beginning to end, and fixed up the story
they should tell Captain Putnam when he returned.
According to their idea the cadets were
to blame for everything and had assaulted them
most outrageously. Crabtree had already interviewed
one of the men hired by him at Cedarville
and this fellow was ready to corroborate
any tale the instructors might put forth.</p>
<p>The teachers had just about finished their talk
when they heard a hurried knock on the door of
the office and one of the waiters appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook and the head waiter would like you
to come to the kitchen at once, please!&rdquo; cried the
colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of the eating has been stolen, sah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; screamed Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah. They jess found it out, sah, and
they sent me to tell you, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is&mdash;er&mdash;extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those confounded boys!&rdquo; roared Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;They must have gotten to the kitchen
somehow and taken the things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the guards&mdash;you forget the guards,&rdquo; returned
Pluxton Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one of them was bribed&mdash;and perhaps
a waiter was bribed too,&rdquo; said Crabtree with
something like a groan. &ldquo;Oh, I know no longer
whom to trust here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the teachers followed the waiter to the
kitchen. Here they found the cook and several
others talking excitedly. Nobody could tell exactly
what had been taken, but the cook was
certain it was considerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have outwitted us!&rdquo; moaned Pluxton
Cuddle. &ldquo;Now they will stuff themselves and
be more ugly than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to find out if they are in league
with anybody outside,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree, and
started without delay to interview all the hired
help around the Hall and also the men from Cedarville.
Each and every person, of course, declared
he or she knew absolutely nothing of the
missing food and had had no communication
whatever with the cadets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are following your ordars, sah,&rdquo; declared
the head waiter. &ldquo;Right or wrong, we
are following &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I am in the right?&rdquo; demanded
Josiah Crabtree, sourly.</p>
<p>At this the colored man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fo&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Putnam to say, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! then you side with the boys, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sidin&rsquo; at all, sah. I obeys orders, that&rsquo;s
all, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; growled the teacher and walked
off, followed by Pluxton Cuddle. Then the
teachers held another conference.</p>
<p>In the meantime the imprisoned cadets ate
what they had for dinner with keen satisfaction,
and then put away the rest of the food for future
use.</p>
<p>They had hardly finished when they heard footsteps
in the hallway and heard somebody talk to
the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Peleg Snuggers,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Wonder what he wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, in there!&rdquo; called out the man of all
work, pounding on the door with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Peleg! What&rsquo;s this, a bombardment?&rdquo;
asked Jack, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t no bombardment,&rdquo; answered the
man. &ldquo;I want to talk to Major Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking to him now, Peleg, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are to come down to the office to onct,&rdquo;
went on the general utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants me?&rdquo; asked the young major, in
considerable astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree. He wants to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he want anybody else?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, look out,&rdquo; whispered Dale. &ldquo;This may
be some trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d go,&rdquo; came from Bart. &ldquo;There
is no telling what those teachers may be up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of them,&rdquo; answered the young
major bravely. &ldquo;Perhaps they want to compromise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye comin&rsquo; or not?&rdquo; demanded Peleg
Snuggers, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come unless the door is unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll unlock it. But, remember, nobody but
Ruddy is to come out,&rdquo; went on the man of all
work.</p>
<p>With great caution the door was unfastened
by Peleg Snuggers and the guard, and Jack was
allowed to pass into the hallway. Then the door
was fastened as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack!&rdquo; called out Pepper. &ldquo;If everything
is O. K. we&rsquo;ll look for you back inside of
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>He was accompanied downstairs by Peleg
Snuggers. Several times the general utility man
seemed to be on the point of speaking, but he
did not say a word until the door of the office
was gained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care o&rsquo; yourself!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.
&ldquo;Sorry I can&rsquo;t do nuthin&rsquo; for ye!&rdquo; And then
he opened the door and allowed Jack to enter.</p>
<p>The young major found Josiah Crabtree seated
at Captain Putnam&rsquo;s desk. The teacher had a
slip of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, I wish you would read that,&rdquo;
he said, shortly.</p>
<p>Wondering what the paper would contain, Jack
took it and started to read. As he did so he was
attacked from behind and a rope was quickly
passed from one wrist to another. In the meantime
a folded towel was held over his mouth, so
that he might not cry out. Although he struggled
he was no match for Pluxton Cuddle and
the guards, and in a very few minutes he was
a helpless prisoner. A loose gag was placed in
his mouth, so that to call out was impossible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to have to treat you in this
fashion,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree, with a wicked
gleam of triumph in his eyes. &ldquo;But your conduct,
and the conduct of your associates, has rendered
it necessary. I trust by to-morrow you
will be in a proper frame of mind to come to
terms. Mr. Cuddle, you may have him taken
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jack was led from the office to the rear
of the Hall, where there was a sort of guardroom.
This was an apartment not over ten feet
square and having a single window, high up from
the floor. Outside, a tall iron fence ran around
the window in the form of a semi-circle. In the
guardroom were two chairs and a washstand.
The place was damp and gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here for the present,&rdquo; said Pluxton
Cuddle, as he thrust Jack inside. Then the
gag was removed, and his hands were unfastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall report this outrage to Captain Putnam,&rdquo;
answered the young major. And then the
door was closed and locked on him, and he was
left alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE ESCAPE FROM THE GUARDROOM</span></h2>
<p>The young major was in no agreeable frame
of mind when he found himself locked in the
guardroom. He had been attacked in an underhanded
fashion and rather roughly treated, and
one button had been torn from his uniform. He
sat down on a chair and shut his teeth tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the limit,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;When I get
out I rather think I&rsquo;ll make it warm for both
Crabtree and Cuddle! They have no right whatever
to treat me in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed&mdash;to the young
major it appeared a much longer time&mdash;when he
heard footsteps approaching and the door was
unlocked. He sprang up, hoping for freedom.
But he was mistaken, instead another cadet was
thrown into the room, protesting loudly. Then
the door was secured as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ritter!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you are here, eh?&rdquo; cried the school
bully. &ldquo;I thought I was to be alone. This is a
fine way to treat a student.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that for sarcasm I agree with
you,&rdquo; answered the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, was it you gave me away to old Crabtree?&rdquo;
demanded Reff Ritter suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Reff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent Peleg Snuggers up to the door of our
dormitory, stating he wanted to have a talk with
me. As soon as I got to the office Cuddle and
some of those outside guards pounced on me like
a lot of wolves. I gave Cuddle a good one in
the nose and he hit me over the head with a cane&mdash;and
then I was thrown in here. Somebody
must have told them about the inkwell and the
hot potatoes and plates. I believe it was you!&rdquo;
And Ritter gave Jack an ugly look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word, Reff&mdash;I give my word of
honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you, Jack Ruddy. If you
didn&rsquo;t, why am I here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, why am I here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, excepting as a witness against
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Reff. Whether you believe
it or not, I did not tell Crabtree a word
about you&mdash;in fact, your name wasn&rsquo;t mentioned
to me. I was asked to come down to the office
and I went&mdash;and then I was attacked from behind,
made a prisoner, and brought here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered the bully, and that was all
he said for the time being.</p>
<p>Several more minutes passed and then from a
distance they heard a sudden cry for help. Both
leaped up from their chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Bob Grenwood&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack. &ldquo;It came from the direction of the office.
Maybe they are serving him as they served us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; returned Reff Ritter, and his face
lost some of its gloomy look. It was a case of
&ldquo;misery loves company,&rdquo; with him. The young
major&rsquo;s words proved true, and in a few minutes
the former quartermaster of the Hall battalion
was thrown violently into the guardroom. His
collar was partly torn, and blood was flowing
from a scratch on his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have had quite a time with you,
Bob,&rdquo; said Jack, after greeting the new arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure did!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;We had a
pitched battle in the office, and Crabtree hit me
in the mouth and I landed on his left eye. I
guess he&rsquo;ll carry the eye in mourning for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if they were going to make all of
us prisoners one by one,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;This guardroom won&rsquo;t hold over a dozen,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;What will they do with the rest?
I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo; he added suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree is sending for the leader of
every dormitory. More than likely he thinks if
he can get the leaders under lock and key the
other cadets will knuckle under to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; growled Reff Ritter.
&ldquo;When I came away Mumps and Billy Sabine
wanted to give in. Mumps, the sneak, was
scared half to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they take the leader from each dormitory
you&rsquo;ll soon see Frank Barringer and Mart Ballock
coming along,&rdquo; said Bob Grenwood.</p>
<p>The three youths talked the situation over until
another noise was heard in the hallway. Then
Frank Barringer was shoved into the guardroom.
He was a dignified, gentlemanly youth and
showed little resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle, I protest against such rough
treatment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall hold you responsible
for what you have done. If Captain Putnam
will not take up the matter, I shall get my
father to do so. I thought this was a young
gentlemen&rsquo;s school, not a penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, sir, don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rdquo; spluttered
Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;I know what I am doing!&rdquo;
And then the door was banged into
Frank&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Number Four!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;We are gradually
filling the ranks. Before long we&rsquo;ll have
enough recruits for an awkward squad!&rdquo; And
he smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mart Ballock next,&rdquo; said Bob Grenwood, and
he was right, the cadet mentioned was thrown
into the guardroom a few minutes later. Then
came two more cadets, the head lads in two other
dormitories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I&rsquo;ve got a scheme,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;There
are now seven of us here. Why not try to break
away when they come with the next cadet? I&rsquo;d
rather be out of the school than in such a gloomy
hole as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am with you!&rdquo; answered Bob Grenwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may mean some fighting,&rdquo; mused Frank
Barringer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; blustered Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
fight if the rest will. Let us give it to &rsquo;em good
when they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we get away, where are we to go to?&rdquo;
questioned Mart Ballock. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a cent of
money with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can camp out, if we can&rsquo;t do anything
else,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We could get a tent or two,
some provisions, and go up the lake shore&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; exclaimed another
cadet. &ldquo;We could remain out till Captain Putnam
came back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;What of the other fellows?&rdquo; asked Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can join us if they want to,&rdquo; answered
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a regular rebellion,&rdquo; said Frank
Barringer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we are justified, Frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Jack&mdash;under the circumstances we
are justified in doing almost anything. Besides,
if we get away, I&rsquo;ll have a chance to send that
telegram to Captain Putnam. It ought to be
sent at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have some plan of action,&rdquo; said
Bob Grenwood. &ldquo;After we break away what
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to fix it so that the fellows left behind
will know what we are up to,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;Perhaps they might get out tonight
and follow us&mdash;if they wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After considerable discussion it was decided
that, given the chance, each cadet should get out
of the Hall as best he could. All were to meet
later at the ruins of an old barn, half a mile
up the lake shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be worried if I don&rsquo;t show up on time,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;If I can I want to let the other fellows
know what is going on.&rdquo; And then he
told of the hole in the closet ceiling and of how
it led to the trunk room above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>There was little time to say more, for soon
more footsteps sounded in the hallway and again
the door was opened. This time the prisoner was
Fred Century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, all together!&rdquo; shouted Jack, and
leaped for the half-closed door. &ldquo;Come on,
Fred!&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We are off for Bailey&rsquo;s old
barn.&rdquo; He spoke the last words softly, so that
those outside might not hear.</p>
<p>Then came a wild rush, and blows were freely
exchanged between the guards and Pluxton Cuddle
and the cadets. One of the guards was
thrown down and the other received a kick in the
shins that made him roar with pain. Cuddle
made a grab for Jack, but Reff Ritter caught
him by the ankles and threw him on his back,
where he lay for the moment, his wind knocked
out of him.</p>
<p>The encounter made considerable noise, and
before the cadets could get away Josiah Crabtree
and one of the guards from upstairs appeared on
the scene. Crabtree held a cane in his hand and
struck several lads. Then Jack caught hold of
the cane and wrenched it from the teacher&rsquo;s
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t hit me, Ruddy!&rdquo; gasped the
teacher, as he saw the cane go up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then get out of our way!&rdquo; answered the
young major, and Josiah Crabtree shrank back
in terror. The next moment Jack was bounding
through the hallway, and the other cadets scattered
in several directions. Some went into the
classrooms and out of the windows while two ran
out of a side door. Jack mounted a side stairs,
skipped past a guard who looked bewildered and
frightened, and then sped for the trunk room.
But as he reached the door his heart failed him.
He remembered how the door had been barricaded
from the inside by a heavy trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t shove it back, I can&rsquo;t get in!&rdquo; he
thought, and tried the door. Just as he did so
it came open, and to his surprise he found himself
confronted by Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; gasped The Imp. &ldquo;Where have you
been? I was just going on a scouting expedition
after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the door&mdash;and push the trunk back into
place,&rdquo; answered the young major. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
great story to tell,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We are now in
open rebellion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">HOW THE CADETS RAN AWAY</span></h2>
<p>While the uproar below was still in progress,
Jack and Pepper climbed down to the dormitory,
and there the young major told of all that had
occurred since his departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle are carrying
matters with a high hand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and
we have decided to stand it no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we about reached the same conclusion
here,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Pepper was going to try to
find you, and then we were going to see if we
couldn&rsquo;t get the whole crowd to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope none of the fellows who were in the
guardroom with me are captured,&rdquo; continued
Jack. &ldquo;If Crabtree or Cuddle laid his hands on
anyone it will go hard with that cadet, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>The guards had all gone below, so the cadets
in the dormitories were left to themselves. They
crowded to the various windows and soon espied
Bob Grenwood, Reff Ritter and two others on
the road beyond the campus. As soon as the
runaway cadets saw that they were noticed they
raised their hands and beckoned for those left
behind to join them. At this the cadets in the
windows nodded vigorously. And so the plan to
run away from Putnam Hall grew rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see two of the guards going after those
cadets,&rdquo; said one student who chanced to have a
field glass. &ldquo;But I doubt if they catch our fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon be night,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;In the
darkness getting away ought to be easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided the teachers don&rsquo;t get a stronger
guard,&rdquo; answered Stuffer. &ldquo;Now they are on the
warpath there is no telling how far they will go.
I expect to see one of the cadets beheaded next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or made to learn ten pages of Latin backward,&rdquo;
put in Joe Nelson, and this remark
caused everybody to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are going to run away, we want some
definite plan of action,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my
own idea, but I don&rsquo;t know if it will suit the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the plan?&rdquo; asked several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we get away as best we can, and, if possible,
get some tents and rations, too. If we can&rsquo;t
get the rations from the pantry and the storehouse,
get them from the storekeepers of Cedarville.
I am sure we can raise some money, and
we can get trust for the rest. Then we can go
off and establish a regular camp until we hear
from Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>This plan met with instant favor, and the idea
was quickly circulated to some of the other dormitories.
Fully three-quarters of the cadets
agreed to run away, if the chance offered. The
others, including Mumps and Billy Sabine, were
too timid and said they would not go.</p>
<p>Of the lads who had broken out of the guardroom
only one was captured and that was Frank
Barringer. He and Josiah Crabtree had a warm
discussion after the capture, and what Barringer
said made the teacher somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are carrying matters with a high hand,
Mr. Crabtree, and when Captain Putnam comes
back I feel certain he will not uphold you,&rdquo; said
Barringer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have order,&rdquo; grumbled the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, but you must try to get it in the
right way. To treat the cadets as if they were
hoodlums is not the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know what we are doing,&rdquo; interposed
Pluxton Cuddle. &ldquo;You boys eat too much,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle, I am talking to Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo;
said Barringer, with dignity. &ldquo;He is the oldest
teacher in the Hall, and he is responsible for
what is happening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am responsible for what happened in the
classrooms,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree, quickly.
&ldquo;The outside care of the students was left to
Mr. Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know what I am doing,&rdquo; said that
individual, pompously. &ldquo;I am willing to assume
all responsibility, and I want no advice from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;we&rsquo;ll wait till Captain Putnam gets
back,&rdquo; said Frank; and there the discussion
ended. But the talk made Josiah Crabtree nervous
and after that he left the management of affairs
largely in Pluxton Cuddle&rsquo;s hands. Perhaps
he was &ldquo;casting an anchor to windward,&rdquo; and he
had need to, as later events proved.</p>
<p>Before the excitement attending the escape
from the guardroom came to an end, it was
growing dark. When it was time for supper
the door to each dormitory was suddenly thrust
open and a basket was set inside, containing bread
and butter and a tin pail full of milk, with a
glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, they have given up the idea of starving
us!&rdquo; cried Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Nothing but bread and butter!&rdquo;
grumbled Stuffer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad some of that other
grub is left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are afraid to let us go without food,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;Perhaps they think we&rsquo;ll grow desperate
on empty stomachs and break down the
doors and create trouble generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a great shame old Crabtree is so pig-headed,&rdquo;
observed Emerald. &ldquo;I shall be greatly
surprised if the captain is afther upholdin&rsquo; him
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it was growing dark the boys completed,
as far as they could, their plans for leaving Putnam
Hall. Of course, much depended on chance
and there was considerable fear that their actions
might fail. Word was circulated that the movement
should commence at exactly midnight, and
in the meanwhile every cadet should pretend to
go to sleep.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the boys, nature aided them
in their undertaking. Heavy clouds obscured the
sky, making it very dark outside of the school.
From a distance came the low rumble of thunder,
drowning out many other sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t rain,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That storm
is passing off to the westward.&rdquo; And he was
right, hardly a drop of rain fell in the vicinity of
the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>A heavy rope had been procured and this was
strung along the windows of the various dormitories
and by its aid many of the cadets climbed
into the room occupied by Jack and his chums.
Then Andy went through the trunk room to the
upper hall and from thence, by a ladder, to the
roof. From that point of vantage he let down the
rope to the window of a dormitory on the other
side of the building. To the end of the rope was
a note reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Use this to get down to the ground. Wait
until we make a noise down by the gym., to attract
the guards. Meet us at the old Bailey barn.
Bring camping outfit with you, if possible.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rebels.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To deceive the guards in the hallways, many
of the cadets pretended to go to bed about eleven
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well get a good night&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; said
Jack loudly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything more until
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Bart Conners, in
an equally loud voice. &ldquo;Call it off, boys, and get
to bed.&rdquo; And this ruse was worked in every dormitory
from which the cadets hoped to escape.
It deceived the guards completely, and when
Pluxton Cuddle came up to learn how matters
were progressing he was informed that the cadets
had retired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>At one minute after twelve the boys arose
from the beds upon which they had been resting,
and with their shoes and various bundles in their
hands crawled silently through the hole in the
ceiling to the trunk room above. Then, with
Jack to lead them, they tiptoed their way through
the back hall and down the rear stairs, and then
to the kitchen. Here the back door was opened,
and ten of the lads went out and in the direction
of the barn and storehouse. This detail
was led by Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want at least ten tents,&rdquo; said the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;And as much food as we can lug
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, why can&rsquo;t we get a horse and wagon?&rdquo;
suggested Stuffer, who hated to carry anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can&mdash;if Jack is willing. But get
out the tents and food first&mdash;so we can dust
with them if there is any alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might take to the boats,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack said that wouldn&rsquo;t be safe. Old
Crabtree would hire a steam tug and come after
us in no time. But say, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can
do&mdash;hide the boats in the creek! That will throw
them off the scent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>In the storehouse were packed a number of
army tents, to be used when the cadets went
out on the annual encampment. Here were also
boxes and barrels of provisions, for use in the
school. Making certain nobody was around, the
boys shut the door, pinned some empty potato
bags over the windows, and lighted a lantern.
Then, with great rapidity, they got out some of
the tents, and in them rolled up various kinds
of rations, beans, bacon, dried fish, coffee, sugar,
butter, crackers and so forth. They also
took along a small sack of potatoes and another
of apples. Then they got out a camp cook
stove, and some tinware, including cups and
plates, and pots, kettles and frying pans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t carry all this,&rdquo; said Dale, in dismay.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll simply have to get a horse and
wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But
it is running an extra risk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">JOSIAH CRABTREE IS WORRIED</span></h2>
<p>While Andy and those with him were getting
out the things in the storehouse, Jack and some
others were searching the pantry and kitchen
for such articles as they thought they needed.
These included knives, forks and spoons, and
also pepper, salt, lard and several smoked hams
and tongues, and all the bread in the big wooden
bread box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take some jam too,&rdquo; said one cadet, and
several glasses were added, and also such cake
as chanced to be in sight. The boys also found
a small cheese, some lemons and oranges and a
box of raisins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ve got all we can carry,&rdquo; said
Fred Century. &ldquo;Talk about moving day! This
looks like one to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As silently as shadows the cadets took the
things outside and hurried with them in the direction
of the storehouse, where they met some of
the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Andy?&rdquo; asked the young major,
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone for a horse and wagon,&rdquo; answered
Dale. &ldquo;It is simply out of the question to carry
all this stuff by hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the risk!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
see how he is making out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran for the stable and saw Andy bringing
forward one of the horses. A spring wagon
stood near by, under a shed, and Pepper ran it
forward, and helped his chum to hitch up the
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, somebody is coming!&rdquo; said Pepper,
presently, and a moment later they heard Peleg
Snuggers calling from his room over the horse
stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s down there? What ye doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; bawled
the man. And then he appeared at a window in
his nightdress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your noise, Snuggers!&rdquo; ordered Pepper.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t they may find a dead man around
here in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sakes alive! Don&rsquo;t shoot me!&rdquo; spluttered
the man of all work, and dropped out of
sight in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say a word and you won&rsquo;t be
touched,&rdquo; went on The Imp. &ldquo;If you open your
mouth there will be trouble, and lots of it, Peleg!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; nary a word!&rdquo; answered the
man, in a voice filled with terror. The doings
of the day had filled him with apprehension.</p>
<p>As quickly as they could the cadets loaded up
the spring wagon, putting in all of the things
collected and adding such additional stores as the
wagon would hold. Then Andy drove off, taking
Dale, Stuffer and some others with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to Daly&rsquo;s clearing,&rdquo; said the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive right into the woods beyond.
I don&rsquo;t think anybody will find us there.&rdquo;
And so it was arranged.</p>
<p>The outfit having been sent on its way, the
cadets left behind breathed more freely. If an
alarm came they could take to their legs, and
they doubted if any of the teachers or guards
could catch them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the demonstration near the gym.,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;Make as much noise as possible, so
the other fellows will have a chance to get out
of the dormitories, but don&rsquo;t let the enemy catch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than five minutes after that a loud yelling
arose back of the gymnasium and several cadets
could be seen running in as many different
directions. There were calls for &ldquo;Come this way,
boys!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Look out, there&rsquo;s a guard after
you!&rdquo; and a lot of other cries that seemed to
mean much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; ejaculated Josiah Crabtree,
who had fallen asleep in an easy chair in his
room. &ldquo;Are they breaking out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the gymnasium!&rdquo; was the call outside.
&ldquo;Catch them, men, at yonder building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a rush from the guards, and they
were quickly joined by Crabtree and Cuddle. All
ran in the direction of the gymnasium, leaving the
school building, for the time being, to take care
of itself.</p>
<p>It was what those left in the dormitories were
watching and waiting for, and in a twinkling
cadet after cadet came sliding down the rope
and a line made of torn-up sheets. They threw
out their bundles in advance, and then, picking
up the baggage, darted for a back path, leading
through the vegetable garden attached to the
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! Look!&rdquo; shrieked Pluxton Cuddle, as
he chanced to gaze behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys! They are leaping from the dormitory
windows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Some of them will be killed.
Ha! I see. They have ropes! Come, this is a
trick&mdash;to get us from the school!&rdquo; And the
teacher ran back toward Putnam Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>By this time the guards were thoroughly bewildered
and did not know what to do. Crabtree
gave orders, and Cuddle told them to do
something else, and, as a consequence, nothing
was accomplished. The teachers were frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have&mdash;have run away!&rdquo; gasped Josiah
Crabtree, as, having reached the school, he threw
open the door of one dormitory after another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but the majority. What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle, you are responsible for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir?&rdquo; gasped the new teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir, not at all, Mr. Crabtree! You
started the affair. You are responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true. If you had not cut down the
food&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! tut! tut! If you had not made a mistake
in that Latin lesson, sir, the cadets&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me, sir! I say it was your fault,
Mr. Cuddle,&rdquo; growled Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say, sir, it was your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the two teachers glared fiercely at
each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, what do you want us to do?&rdquo;
asked one of the guards, somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do
anything! You allowed those cadets to run
away! You are a set of blockheads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are, blockheads!&rdquo; added Pluxton
Cuddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a blockhead and I want you to know
it,&rdquo; answered the man angrily. &ldquo;You fellers
brought us up here on a fool&rsquo;s errand, I think.
If you&rsquo;ll pay me off I&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, pay me off and I&rsquo;ll go home too,&rdquo; added
another of the guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you going to desert us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Josiah Crabtree, in sudden fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no blockhead. You pay me and I&rsquo;ll
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, you promised to stay here as
long as wanted,&rdquo; pleaded Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me any longer&mdash;now the boys
have run away. And let me say one thing&mdash;I
think the boys had a right to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You teachers ain&rsquo;t treatin&rsquo; &rsquo;em right,&rdquo; went
on another guard. &ldquo;Just you wait till Captain
Putnam gits back&mdash;I reckon he&rsquo;ll make it warm
for you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>At this plain talk Josiah Crabtree almost collapsed.
He realized that he had gone too far.
He wondered what the result would be when the
captain did get back. He was getting a fine
salary and he did not wish to lose his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellows, you are making a mistake,&rdquo;
he said, in a milder voice. &ldquo;Those cadets have
broken the rules of this institution and must be
punished. I was simply going to keep them in
their rooms until to-morrow and then I was going
to give them a lecture, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the grub they wanted?&rdquo; asked
another guard, who had come up during the talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little hunger would do them good. They
would have gotten their fill to-morrow, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! that&rsquo;s a mistake!&rdquo; burst out Pluxton
Cuddle. &ldquo;Too much eating&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cuddle, I no longer agree with you on
that point,&rdquo; said Josiah Crabtree coldly. &ldquo;If they
return they shall have the same quantity of food
as they got when Captain Putnam was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Then you have not the boys&rsquo; welfare
at heart,&rdquo; snorted the new teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you men to stay here, at least for
the present,&rdquo; continued Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;Let
me see, I believe I promised you two dollars a
day, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said one of the guards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your work has not been pleasant and therefore
I&rsquo;ll make the pay three dollars a day. I did
not mean to call you blockheads&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;was excited.
Let us get down to&mdash;er&mdash;business now&mdash;and
see if we cannot find those runaway cadets
and persuade them to return to the Hall. If
we can do that and&mdash;er&mdash;hush up this whole unpleasant
matter I will&mdash;er&mdash;reward you handsomely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This talk was &ldquo;pouring oil on the troubled
waters,&rdquo; and in the end the guards promised to
stick by Josiah Crabtree and do what they could
to bring the cadets back to school. They also
promised, in view of a liberal reward, to tell Captain
Putnam that the students and not the teachers
were to blame for the outbreak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">A DISCOVERY IN THE WOODS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, look out that you don&rsquo;t drive off the
road and into the gully,&rdquo; said Stuffer, as the
spring wagon lurched forward over the rough
ground leading to Daly&rsquo;s clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffer wouldn&rsquo;t have you lose any of that
food for a fortune,&rdquo; said Dale, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Trust him to look out for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be just as ready to eat your
breakfast as anybody,&rdquo; grumbled the cadet who
loved to eat.</p>
<p>Forward rolled the wagon, groaning dubiously
when it bounded over the rocks. It was loaded
to the limit and the boys feared that the springs
would break before the journey was over.</p>
<p>From the vicinity of the Hall came calls and
considerable noise. But this presently died away,
and then all was as quiet as a tomb on the woody
road the runaway cadets were traveling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>In half an hour the clearing was gained. They
drove across it, and into the woods beyond for a
distance of a hundred yards. Here it was so
dark they had to light a lantern to see the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be good ones if they track us to this
spot,&rdquo; observed Dale.</p>
<p>Having reached the place, they blanketed the
horse and sat down to wait. It was somewhat
chilly and all of the cadets present were glad
enough to put on the heavy coats they had
brought along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think some of us ought to go over
to Bailey&rsquo;s barn and see if the others have arrived?&rdquo;
asked Stuffer, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might do that,&rdquo; answered another cadet.
&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t all go. Somebody must remain
here and watch the horse and the outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end it was decided that Andy and Stuffer
should make the journey to the old Bailey
barn, a distance of a mile or more. They set off
at once, Stuffer first, however, filling his pockets
with crackers and apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a path right through these woods,&rdquo;
said Stuffer. &ldquo;It will bring us out just to the
north of the old barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be sure of the way,&rdquo; answered the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get lost in this
darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we get lost in the dark if we carry
a lantern, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easily enough&mdash;if you get twisted around,
Stuffer. I was lost once, in the Adirondacks, and
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys set off, Andy carrying a small
lantern picked up in the carriage shed. This gave
more smoke and smell than light and they had to
proceed slowly, for fear of tumbling over the tree
roots or into some hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Stuffer, presently, as a strange
sound struck his ears from close at hand.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an owl,&rdquo; cried Andy, with a laugh.
&ldquo;How you jumped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it was an&mdash;an owl?&rdquo; was the
nervous question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead certain. Go ahead, or we won&rsquo;t reach
the old barn till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The path through the woods was not well defined
and at one place forked in several directions.
Stuffer did not notice this and kept to
the right when he should have gone to the left.
Andy followed without question, and thus the
two cadets, instead of nearing the old barn,
plunged deeper and deeper into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Stuffer, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be right,&rdquo;
observed Andy, after a full mile and a half had
been covered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I know I am right,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to the barn in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued to go forward, up a slight rise
of ground and then down into something of a
hollow. Andy was just about to say again that
he thought they were on the wrong path when
he caught sight of a small campfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, see that!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have arrived and lit a fire!&rdquo; answered
Stuffer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame them. It is pretty cold.
But they are running the risk of being discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuffer, this isn&rsquo;t the location of the old barn.
We are not near the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The locality doesn&rsquo;t look like it. These are
hemlock trees, while back of the barn there are
chestnuts and walnuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so too,&rdquo; and now Stuffer became
doubtful.</p>
<p>Moving a little more slowly, the two boys drew
closer to the campfire. They saw that it was in
a little clearing, to one side of which were some
rocks and a spring of water. On the other side
several small trees had been cut down and a rude
shelter erected, covered with an old wagon top
and several old horse blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a gypsy camp,&rdquo; said Stuffer, in a low
tone, as the two boys stepped behind some bushes
to gaze at the scene presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are tramps,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the hoboes lying around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the forms of three men resting
near the campfire. They were all rough-looking
individuals and their clothing and shoes were
much dilapidated. Several empty bottles lay
scattered around, indicating that the fellows were
drinkers. Near the shelter were a pile of chicken
feathers and the skin of a lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think,&rdquo; whispered Andy.
&ldquo;These are not only tramps but also thieves.
They have been robbing the farmers&rsquo; henroosts
and somebody&rsquo;s sheepfold. They&rsquo;ve got a regular
hangout here. I wonder how many of them
there are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see three&mdash;but some of the crowd may be
under the shelter. If they are thieves they ought
to be locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Shall we go into the camp and ask
them the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ought to trust them. They
might detain us, and rob us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Putting out the light so that they might not be
discovered, the two cadets walked around the
camp of the tramps. They saw that it was a
hangout that had been used for some time. With
great caution they stole up to the back of the
rude shelter and peered within. They saw three
more men, who were all snoring lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes six all told,&rdquo; said Stuffer, as he
and his chum withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice that fellow who was in the
corner?&rdquo; demanded Andy, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I am greatly mistaken he is the fellow
I saw in the jewelry store the day I was
robbed&mdash;the chap I thought might be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so, Andy? Are you certain it is the
fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because I didn&rsquo;t get a good look at his
face. But he certainly looked a good deal like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to investigate&mdash;I mean later
on, when we have some of the others with us,&rdquo;
went on Stuffer hastily. &ldquo;It would be foolish for
us to tackle six men alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back some time to-morrow&mdash;if I
can get a crowd to come along,&rdquo; was the reply
from the acrobatic youth. &ldquo;Beyond a doubt these
fellows are thieves, and the farmers around here
would be glad to place them under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case let the Putnam Hall cadets make
the capture. It will be quite a feather in our
cap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get back that stolen medal and the
ring,&rdquo; said Andy, as they moved away from the
tramps&rsquo; hangout. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to see the guilty
party punished for attacking me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having withdrawn into the woods once more
the two cadets set to work to find the right path
to the old barn. This was no easy task, and it
was not until almost daybreak that Andy gave a
cry and pointed ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the lake! I think I know where we are
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried on and Stuffer came behind him,
and presently the pair struck a wagon road running
directly past the old Bailey barn. They ran
up to the structure, to be stopped by a cadet who
was on guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt and give the countersign!&rdquo; cried the
cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;That sounds natural.
Is the crowd here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; answered the cadet. &ldquo;How did you
make out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy told him and then went in the barn,
where he found the other cadets assembled, some
sleeping and a few talking in low tones. Four
guards had been stationed outside, to give the
alarm, should the enemy be seen approaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well be on the move,&rdquo; said
Jack, after Andy and Stuffer had told their story.
&ldquo;As soon as it is daylight Crabtree and Cuddle
will most likely send somebody out to look for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we want to make a regular camp
somewhere,&rdquo; put in Stuffer. &ldquo;Then we can start
a fire and cook a good breakfast, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy who loved to eat did not finish for
several began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make Stuffer head cook,&rdquo; cried Pepper.
&ldquo;Stuffer, how does that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;if only you won&rsquo;t ask me to wash
dishes,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody will have to do his share of work,&rdquo;
said Jack, and looked knowingly at Pepper. Then
he leaned over and whispered in Andy&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I
am afraid we are going to have trouble with
Reff Ritter and his crowd. Reff wants to have
everything his own way, and he thinks the fellows
ought to make him leader.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">THE RIVAL RUNAWAYS</span></h2>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock that morning the runaway
cadets of Putnam Hall went into camp not a
great distance away from where Andy had driven
the wagon into the woods. They found an ideal
spot in a small clearing surrounded by dense
woods. There the tents were pitched, and some
of the boys cleaned out a handy spring, that all
the water needed might be procured. While some
of the cadets were raising the tents, others, under
the directions of Bob Grenwood and Stuffer,
were preparing breakfast. The cook stove had
been set up, and three cadets had been detailed
by Jack to procure firewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have this camp in apple-pie order before
noon,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;I am going
to observe the same kind of regulations as if we
were off on an annual encampment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the morning one of the cadets had
hurried away to Cedarville, to send a telegram
to Captain Putnam, notifying him of the state
of affairs. A letter was also dropped into the
post-office for the master of the Hall, and this
was marked Private. Then another letter was
sent to Josiah Crabtree, a farm boy being hired
to deliver it. This letter ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Mr. Josiah Crabtree</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>: We have left Putnam Hall to
camp out until the return of Captain Putnam.
To remain at the school under the management
of yourself and Mr. Cuddle was impossible. As
soon as Captain Putnam returns we shall lay our
case before him.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Yours truly,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Students&rsquo; Committee</span>,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Joseph Nelson, Sec&rsquo;y</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that will set old Crabtree to thinking,&rdquo;
was Dale&rsquo;s comment, when the communication
was dispatched. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find out that he can&rsquo;t
do just as he pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it will set that new teacher to thinking
too,&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t I like
to square up with Pluxton Cuddle, for cutting
us short on rations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had told the young major about the
tramps and Jack agreed to see what could be done
as soon as camp matters were arranged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get things into shape here first,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;I feel it in my bones that Ritter is
going to make trouble. Since we ran away he
acts like a regular sorehead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While breakfast was being served Reff Ritter
and Gus Coulter growled at nearly everything
that was being done. The camping spot, to them,
was no good, the tents were not properly placed,
and Reff stated loudly that he would have picked
out a spot that had better drinking water, while
Coulter turned up his nose at the coffee served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is regular dishwater,&rdquo; said Gus. &ldquo;I
thought we ran away to have something good to
eat and to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Gus, if you don&rsquo;t like the coffee,
supposing you make some for yourself,&rdquo; answered
Bob Grenwood, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Maybe you think I can&rsquo;t make coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ham is about half done,&rdquo; came from
Nick Paxton. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fit for a dog to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what can you expect, when those fellows
are running everything to suit themselves?&rdquo;
growled Reff Ritter. &ldquo;If I was leader I&rsquo;d have
things different.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Reff!&rdquo; cried Jack, sharply. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like your talk at all. The boys are doing
the best they can. You can&rsquo;t expect everything
to work like a charm at the very start. We are
all tired out, and what we need is a good night&rsquo;s
sleep. Don&rsquo;t grumble so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grumble if I please!&rdquo; flared up the bully
of the school. &ldquo;You may be major of the battalion
but you can&rsquo;t boss me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to come with us if you didn&rsquo;t
want to,&rdquo; put in Dale. &ldquo;Jack is our leader, and
everybody in this camp has got to obey his
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Then I reckon the best we can do
is to get out,&rdquo; answered Ritter, with a meaning
look at his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, give us our share of the camp stuff and
we&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in favor of going with Reff Ritter raise
their right hand,&rdquo; sang out Nick Paxton.</p>
<p>Evidently the matter had been talked over between
the bully and his cohorts for on the instant
nine hands went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten of us, counting Reff,&rdquo; said Coulter.
&ldquo;How many are there all told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-three,&rdquo; answered Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we number about one-third of the total
and we ought to have one-third of the stuff,&rdquo;
said a cadet who had voted to join Reff Ritter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be fair!&rdquo; cried Hogan. &ldquo;Sure,
and it was Jack and his chums who planned this
thing and who got the most of the goods together,
so they did. Ritter didn&rsquo;t carry a thing
but his own clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;If Ritter
and his crowd want to camp by themselves
let them do it. We&rsquo;ll give them a fair share of
the tents and the provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A warm discussion followed, which almost
ended in a fight. But Jack&rsquo;s suggestion prevailed,
and just before noon Ritter and his nine followers
left, taking with them a share of the tents
and the provisions. The bully wanted more than
was dealt out to him, and went away muttering
that he would pay the others back for their meanness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad they are gone,&rdquo; said Jack, when
the crowd had departed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d never have harmony
with them around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;Just the
same, I think we gave them more than they deserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to keep our eyes peeled for them,&rdquo;
was Dale&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Ritter is just the fellow
to play us some underhanded trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t know when to be
grateful,&rdquo; said Bart Conners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad he is gone,&rdquo; came from Stuffer.
&ldquo;Now we won&rsquo;t have to cook for so many.&rdquo; And
this remark caused a smile.</p>
<p>With the discontented ones gone the camp took
on a more cheerful appearance. Breakfast was
finished, and the few dishes washed, and then the
majority of the cadets laid down to rest, for they
had not had a sound sleep since the rebellion had
begun. Andy and Joe were anxious to go after
the tramps, but Andy could hardly keep his eyes
open, while Joe was little better off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well wait until to-morrow,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely those tramps will
go away in a hurry. Most likely they intend to
stay there until cold weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A guard was set, which was changed every two
hours, and the cadets laid down to rest. The majority
of them slept &ldquo;like logs,&rdquo; and it was again
dark when they commenced to stir around, and
Stuffer began preparations for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what is going on at the Hall,&rdquo; said
Jack, as he stretched himself. &ldquo;Crabtree and the
others must be hunting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they do, so long as they
don&rsquo;t find us,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>In the evening Pepper and Andy set off for
Cedarville, to buy some things that were needed
in the camp. They took to the regular road,
thinking they could easily get out of sight if any
of the enemy appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>As they walked along they saw a buggy approaching.
It contained two girls, and as it came
closer Pepper uttered an exclamation of pleasure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura Ford and her sister Flossie! Won&rsquo;t
they be surprised when they learn what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls he mentioned were two old friends
of the cadets. They were the daughters of a Mr.
Rossmore Ford, a rich gentleman who owned a
summer cottage called Point View Lodge, located
on the lake shore. In the past the boys
had done the girls several services of importance
and the young ladies and their parents were correspondingly
grateful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">NEWS OF INTEREST</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;ve really and truly run away!&rdquo;
cried Laura Ford, after Pepper and Andy had
told their story. &ldquo;What fun! I wish I was a
cadet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How angry that Mr. Crabtree must be!&rdquo; came
from Flossie, as she tossed back her curls. &ldquo;Of
course he&rsquo;ll tell Captain Putnam it was all your
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going now?&rdquo; asked Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Cedarville&mdash;to buy some things we need.
You see, we came off in such a hurry we forgot
some things,&rdquo; and The Imp grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we help you?&rdquo; asked Flossie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
dearly love to&mdash;you boys have done so much for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might bake us some pies,&rdquo; suggested Andy,
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing&mdash;only we&rsquo;ll get the cook to do
the baking. We&rsquo;ll have the pies for you to-morrow.
Where shall we bring them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be too much trouble,&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll get the pies for you&mdash;and some cake
too. Just tell us where to bring them,&rdquo; said
Laura. &ldquo;Can we visit your camp? I&rsquo;d like to
see what it looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll feel honored,&rdquo; said Pepper, and then
he told where the camp was located. The girls
said they would have the coachman drive them as
close as possible to the spot and would get there
early enough, so the cadets could have the pies
for dinner. Then the two parties separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now those are girls worth knowing!&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;Always willing to treat a fellow just
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Stuffer would think so&mdash;if he knew
about the pies,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like
a piece of good pie myself.&rdquo; And he smacked his
lips.</p>
<p>The boys hurried to Cedarville and there procured
the articles they wanted. Then they asked
several people if any chicken thieves had been
around lately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; said one man. &ldquo;Tom Robinson
lost some chickens last week, and so did Billy
Peters and the Widow Lilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any lambs stolen?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that Landerson the butcher, had a
lamb stolen a couple of weeks ago. He just bought
it from a man over to Hoetown. What do you
want to know for? Do you know anything about
the thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do. I&rsquo;ll go over and ask the butcher
about the lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the butcher shop the two cadets had quite a
talk, the upshot of which was that the butcher
said he would visit the camp on the following
afternoon, bringing two farmers who had lost
chickens with him. He let the boys have some
fresh meat on trust, and smiled broadly when
they asked him not to tell anybody where their
camp was located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know something about the trouble up to the
school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of them teachers&mdash;I
think his name is Crabapple, or something like
that&mdash;wanted my cousin, Jim Pepperhill, to go up
there to keep order. But Jim didn&rsquo;t like the looks
of the teacher and wouldn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Crabtree say what the trouble was?&rdquo;
asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said some of the boys wouldn&rsquo;t behave themselves,
and that they had to be locked in their
bedrooms and kept there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>From the butcher shop the two cadets visited
the post-office, to see if there was any mail for
themselves and their fellow students. To their
surprise they were told that another cadet had
called there only half an hour before and taken
all the cadets&rsquo; mail away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; asked Andy, and the clerk described
the person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think his name is Coulter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
has been here for mail before. Wasn&rsquo;t it all
right to give it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just now,&rdquo; answered Pepper. &ldquo;After
this you keep some of the mail here until one of
our party calls for it.&rdquo; And he wrote down a
list of names. Then he and his chum hurried
off in the direction of camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mighty cheeky of Coulter to take all
the mail!&rdquo; grumbled Andy. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he sort
it out and hand our mail back? Now we have
got to wait until he gets ready to bring it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he won&rsquo;t bring it, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to go for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that we don&rsquo;t know where the
Ritter crowd is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, that&rsquo;s so! Well, we will have to
find out. If he&rsquo;s got any of my mail, I want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boys got back to camp the others
listened with interest to what they had to tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be fun to go after those tramps and
clean them out,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;And if the fellow
is there who attacked Andy I hope we catch him
and get back the stolen things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home-made pies!&rdquo; murmured Stuffer, referring
to what the boys said about the Ford girls.
&ldquo;Yum! yum! That&rsquo;s the best ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that would make a bull&rsquo;s-eye hit with
you!&rdquo; said Pepper, with a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they bring enough to go around. Did
you tell them how many there were of us?&rdquo; asked
the boy who loved to eat, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them there were over half a dozen of
us,&rdquo; answered Pepper, with a wink at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pepper! Half a dozen! Then they&rsquo;ll
only bring two or three pies, and we won&rsquo;t get
more than a mouthful apiece!&rdquo; And Stuffer&rsquo;s
face took on a mournful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Master Singleton,&rdquo; said The
Imp, imitating Pluxton Cuddle&rsquo;s tone of voice.
&ldquo;Too much eating is bad for a youth. It makes
him stupid and incapable of studying properly.
If one ate less&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop your tommy-rot about eating less!&rdquo;
roared Stuffer. &ldquo;I guess you must really believe
in it&mdash;or you wouldn&rsquo;t let those Ford girls bring
only two or three pies.&rdquo; And he turned to walk
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Stuffer, Pep was only fooling,&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll bring enough pies, don&rsquo;t you
worry.&rdquo; And then the youth who loved to eat
felt relieved.</p>
<p>A campfire was kept going during the evening,
and around this the runaway cadets gathered,
to tell stories, sing songs and speculate upon how
the whole affair was to end. A few were nervous,
but others felt certain that Captain Putnam
would not blame them for what they had
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, he is not the man I take him to
be,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he sides with Crabtree and Cuddle I shall
ask my father to send me to another school,&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we stick together he is bound to side with
us,&rdquo; added Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t make such a mistake as that,&rdquo;
said Jack, to the last speaker. &ldquo;Captain Putnam
will not be influenced by our sticking together,
even if it breaks up his school. He will decide
this case solely on its merits. But I hope he will
see that we were in the right&mdash;at least, that we
were not as much in the wrong as Josiah Crabtree
and Pluxton Cuddle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Among the boys to be placed on guard when
the cadets retired was Fred Century. He was
stationed at the east side of the camp, not far
from where the wagon stood and the horse was
tethered. In the wagon were a goodly part of
the provisions, covered with a tarpaulin that had
been brought along.</p>
<p>Fred had not slept well the night before and
was consequently sleepy. He tramped around
for a while and then sat down on a rock to rest.</p>
<p>He had been sitting still for several minutes,
with his eyes partly closed, when he heard a
slight noise behind him. Before he could move
a cloth was clapped around his mouth and his
hands were caught and held. Then a rope was
brought into play, and he was made a close prisoner
and carried away into the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">AFTER THE STOLEN CAMP OUTFIT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, fellows, get up! Something has happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Pepper who aroused the others, and he
made such a noise that the cadets who were
asleep sprang up without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the enemy discovered us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going back to the Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a number of other cries rang out,
and nearly all the runaways surrounded The Imp.
For answer Pepper pointed to where the horse
and wagon had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who took them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I missed
them a minute ago and tried to find out what had
become of them. But they are teetotally gone,
and that is all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the guards?&rdquo; demanded Jack.
&ldquo;Brightwood, did you see anything of the horse
and wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; answered one of the cadets who
had been on guard duty. Then some of the
others were questioned, but all shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Century was on guard near the wagon,&rdquo;
said Andy, suddenly. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All looked around, but in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he drove off with the horse and
wagon,&rdquo; suggested Hogan. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know
where he&rsquo;d go, so I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he got afraid and went back to the
Hall,&rdquo; suggested another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Century wasn&rsquo;t the sort to get afraid,&rdquo;
answered the young major. &ldquo;But I must confess
I don&rsquo;t understand this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Reff Ritter and his crowd would
play this trick?&rdquo; demanded Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might, Pep, but what of Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Century joined the Ritter gang,&rdquo;
vouchsafed Brightwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Fred didn&rsquo;t like Ritter at all,&rdquo; answered
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a search for the horse and
wagon,&rdquo; said the young major. &ldquo;And the sooner
the better. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose all those
stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, can&rsquo;t we get breakfast first?&rdquo; asked
Stuffer, reproachfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;ll hunt first and eat afterwards,&rdquo; said
Jack, decidedly.</p>
<p>The cadets scattered in all directions, and less
than three minutes later Dale set up a call that
brought the others running to him. He had
found poor Fred, gagged, and bound to a tree.
The captive was glad to be released and to have
his power of speech restored. His story was a
short one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been four or five who attacked
me from behind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and they gave
me no chance to cry out. I heard them talking
about taking the horse and wagon and some other
things, but I couldn&rsquo;t do a thing to warn any of
you. They must have gotten off very quietly,
not to have attracted the attention of the other
guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they the Ritter crowd?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure. I thought perhaps they might
be those tramps Andy and Stuffer discovered in
a hangout in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tramps!&rdquo; ejaculated Andy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!
Why didn&rsquo;t I think of them! If they rob the
farmers around here, they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to
rob us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, who was on guard next to you?&rdquo; asked
the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caller was on one side and Beck on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Caller is a little deaf, he wouldn&rsquo;t be
apt to hear them,&rdquo; said Pepper. He looked
around. &ldquo;Where is Beck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beck was not in sight, and then the various
cadets stated they had not seen him since he
had gone on guard duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be tied up too,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let us
continue the hunt, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, and the search lasted fully
an hour. But not a trace of the missing cadet
could be discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think,&rdquo; said Pepper, when
they met around the campfire. &ldquo;I think the Ritter
crowd ran off with the horse and wagon and
I think Beck went with them. If you&rsquo;ll remember,
he and Coulter and Paxton are quite
chummy, and Coulter wanted him to come with
them when they left our crowd. I think, if we
can find out where the Ritter crowd is staying,
we can get back our things&mdash;and not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find them,&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>It was soon learned that not only were the
things left in the wagon gone, but also some of
the cooking utensils and the fresh meat purchased
from the butcher in Cedarville. This discovery
made the cadets more angry than ever, and all
vowed to &ldquo;square up&rdquo; with the Ritter crowd if
they were really guilty and if it could possibly
be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;We gave them their share and they had no
right to come here and take more,&rdquo; was the way
Joe Nelson expressed himself.</p>
<p>Breakfast was had, and then Jack divided his
force into three parties. Of these one party was
to remain in camp and watch such of the outfit
as was left. The other parties were to go on a
hunt for the horse and wagon, one going to the
north and the other to the west. The boys tried
to follow the wagon tracks through the woods,
but this was impossible, for many spots were
hard and stony, and here the tracks were not distinguishable.</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper were in the party which
moved to the westward, and they were accompanied
by four other cadets, including Dale.
They spread out in a line, about twenty feet
apart, so that they might cover that portion of
the woods as well as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may prove to be nothing but a wild goose
chase,&rdquo; observed the young major as they moved
along. &ldquo;But it is better than sitting still and doing
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon crossed a clearing, and then came
to a wagon road leading up a small hill. Here
they saw freshly-made tracks and this gave them
some encouragement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any farm up here,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;And if there isn&rsquo;t any farm what would a
wagon be doing here this time of year?&rdquo; For
the road was one for hauling wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not make any noise,&rdquo; cautioned Dale,
as one of the cadets commenced to whistle. &ldquo;We
may be nearer that wagon than you suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved onward for about an eighth of
a mile further, and then Jack called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something moving over yonder,&rdquo; he
said, pointing with his hand. &ldquo;I think we had
better investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With increased caution, for they wished if possible
to surprise the enemy, they went forward,
keeping as much as possible behind the bushes
lining the wood road. Then they made a turn,
and off in a little glade to the left they saw the
horse and wagon, the animal being tied to a tree.
At the edge of the glade were several tents, and
in front of them the remains of a campfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anybody?&rdquo; questioned Pepper, in
a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see Ritter and Coulter, back of the
tents,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I see some of the fellows
in the tents,&rdquo; announced Dale. &ldquo;They are
fast asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely tired out, because of last night&rsquo;s
work,&rdquo; said another cadet. He looked at Jack.
&ldquo;What do you want us to do, Major?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows look in the wagon and see if our
stuff is there,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Come, Pep, let
us walk behind those bushes and see if we can
discover anything more. If Ritter and Coulter
are hatching out more mischief we want to know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am with you,&rdquo; answered The Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the stuff is in the wagon, shall we drive
off with it?&rdquo; questioned Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t go too far, Dale,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;We may want you and the other fellows
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;if you want us, give the signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, while Dale and the others hurried toward
the horse and wagon, Jack and Pepper stole
behind the tents to where Ritter and Coulter were
talking earnestly. Little did the young major
dream of what he was to hear or of the discovery
he was to make.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">A CASE OF TIT FOR TAT</span></h2>
<p>Reff Ritter was evidently in high spirits over
the success of his midnight raid, for his voice
sounded positive and loud. Coulter was a little
bit afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may follow us up,&rdquo; were the first words
Jack and Pepper caught, coming from Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they may try it, but I don&rsquo;t think they
can do it,&rdquo; answered Ritter. &ldquo;We took good
care to keep to the rocks when we left their camp.
They can&rsquo;t follow the wagon tracks. Oh, say,
but it&rsquo;s a rich joke on them, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And the
bully of the Hall chuckled loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is, Reff. But if they found us
out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Coulter shook his head. &ldquo;I suppose
Jack Ruddy would be mad enough to chew us
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that, Reff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think he can find us out. He isn&rsquo;t
as knowing as you think he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he&rsquo;s pretty sharp,&rdquo; insisted Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! He never found out how he happened
to get sick so suddenly the day we had the
gymnastic contest and he fell from the flying-rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you said you&rsquo;d tell me all about that some
day,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;How did you manage it,
Reff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easy enough. If I tell you, will you
keep it to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got that French headache powder out
of the medicine cabinet. I knew about how much
to use to make Ruddy dizzy and dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how did you manage to give it to
him without his knowing it?&rdquo; went on Coulter
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was easy enough. I went down to the
mess room just before the evening parade. I
watched my chance, and when none of the waiters
were looking, I slipped up to Ruddy&rsquo;s seat and
put the powder into the glass of water in front
of his plate. Just as I hoped, he came in feeling
dry, and he drank the stuff without knowing it.
I think he did say something about a bitter taste,
but that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was an all-right trick,&rdquo; said Coulter. &ldquo;Only
it didn&rsquo;t pan out just as you wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jack Ruddy never found out about it,&rdquo;
answered Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;m getting sleepy,&rdquo;
he added, with a yawn. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn in, like the
rest have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to set a guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all the fellows are too tired to stand
guard,&rdquo; was the bully&rsquo;s reply, and then he passed
into one tent and Coulter into another.</p>
<p>With keen interest Jack and Pepper had listened
to every word of the conversation. The
young major could scarcely control himself, and
his chum had to hold him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rascal!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;I always suspected
him of having drugged me, and now I have the
proof. I ought to hammer him well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him see you here,&rdquo; pleaded
Pepper, and pulled his chum back of some bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Pep, that villain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. You&rsquo;d like to pound the
life out of him, and so would I. But we can do
no more&mdash;we can expose him to Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But let me pound him first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Jack. Remember, we are two to
two, and Ritter and Coulter can deny anything
we say. We had better go slow, and fix it so
that, when the time comes for an exposure, Ritter
can&rsquo;t worm out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As angry as he was, the young major saw the
wisdom of this, and he allowed Pepper to draw
him away from the vicinity of the tents. Both
rejoined Dale and the others, who were behind
some bushes close to where the horse was tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our stuff is all in the wagon,&rdquo; announced
Dale. &ldquo;We were going to drive off with it, but
we saw Ritter and Coulter looking this way and
we didn&rsquo;t want to be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;they are going to retire,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;I think in a few minutes every fellow in this
camp will be asleep, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did not
finish but his eyes began to twinkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;I know what you
mean! Tit for tat, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, Dale? Let me tell you fellows
something.&rdquo; And then The Imp repeated the
conversation that had just been overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; demanded Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;word for word. Jack wanted to pound
Ritter then and there, but I made him hold back,
for we want to prove this matter to Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the sort he is, he and his cronies deserve
to be cleaned out,&rdquo; said another cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll clean them out,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave them the tents and their clothing and
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had not long to wait for Ritter and
Coulter to retire. Then, when they felt certain
that all of the enemy were asleep, they stole into
the camp and picked up the cooking utensils and
provisions lying around and loaded them on the
wagon. Then the horse was untied and the journey
back along the wood road was begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can change our own camp this afternoon,&rdquo;
said the young major. &ldquo;And we can fix
it so they won&rsquo;t have an easy time to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when the boys came into
their camp with the horse and wagon. The other
searching party had come back a few minutes before,
much discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; said one of the other searchers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we didn&rsquo;t all fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, don&rsquo;t forget that we expect visitors,&rdquo;
said Andy, a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; exclaimed the young major.
&ldquo;Boys, I want you to put this camp into first-class
shape immediately,&rdquo; he added, and then proceeded
to wash up and brush his hair before the
one tiny mirror brought along from the Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>It was not long after this that a call sounded
through the woods, and then the cadets saw two
men and two girls approaching, each carrying a
basket covered with a napkin. The party consisted
of Mr. Rossmore Ford and his two
daughters, and the family coachman.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="THE CADETS SAW TWO MEN AND TWO GIRLS APPROACHING." width="500" height="765" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">THE CADETS SAW TWO MEN AND TWO GIRLS APPROACHING.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;So this is where you are stopping!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Ford, after the greetings were over. &ldquo;An ideal
spot, I must say, and one pretty well hidden from
the carriage road. I take it that your teachers
haven&rsquo;t found you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me why you rebelled?
I am very much interested,&rdquo; went on the gentleman.</p>
<p>In as few words as possible the young major
told the particulars of the trouble with Josiah
Crabtree and Pluxton Cuddle. Mr. Ford, Laura
and Flossie listened with close attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if all this is true, I do not wonder at
your running away,&rdquo; said Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;I
rather think I should have run away myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the pies, and some cakes and fresh
rolls,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;The pies are apple, lemon
and cocoanut, and we hope you&rsquo;ll like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like them!&rdquo; cried a dozen cadets in chorus.
&ldquo;Just you wait till you see us eat them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only one lad here who doesn&rsquo;t like
pie,&rdquo; went on Pepper, soberly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Paul Singleton.
He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you!&rdquo; cried Stuffer. &ldquo;I like pie as well
as anybody, and you know it. Miss Ford, don&rsquo;t
you pay attention to what he says!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wants all the pie to himself,&rdquo; answered
Flossie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d feel honored to have you take dinner
with us,&rdquo; said Jack to Mr. Ford, after consulting
some of his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us stay, papa! It would be such fun!&rdquo;
pleaded Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; added her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it is not too much trouble&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; murmured
Rossmore Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all!&rdquo; cried the cadets and then
it was arranged that all of the visitors should remain
for the midday meal. This settled, Stuffer
and the other cooks bustled about to get the repast
ready.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">AFTER THE TRAMPS</span></h2>
<p>It was pleasant for Jack and his chums to have
the Fords with them, and all spent an agreeable
hour together, while waiting for the meal and
during the repast. The pies and fresh rolls
proved highly acceptable. The cake Stuffer
wanted to cut, too, but the young major said
that must be kept for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d put on everything in camp, if I let him,&rdquo;
Jack explained to the girls. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the greatest
eater in the school, and that&rsquo;s why we call him
Stuffer. But he&rsquo;s a good fellow all the same,&rdquo;
he added, hastily.</p>
<p>During the meal the boys told Mr. Ford of the
tramps, and what was to be done that afternoon
to capture the fellows. The gentleman was much
interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost fowls over to my place,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Perhaps these men are guilty of the depredations.
If so, I think I ought to have a
hand in this round-up,&rdquo; and he smiled faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can go along if you wish, Mr. Ford,&rdquo;
answered Jack, readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will. The girls can drive home with
Michael.&rdquo; And so it was arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I want you to keep out of harm,&rdquo; said
Laura, on parting. &ldquo;And you boys had better
take care, too,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be on our guard, don&rsquo;t fear,&rdquo; answered
Pepper, and then he and Andy saw the girls to
the carriage, and saw Michael the coachman drive
off with them.</p>
<p>While the cadets were awaiting the arrival of
Landerson the butcher and Peters and Robinson,
two farmers who had lately lost chickens by
stealing, the young major gave some of them directions
where to go and establish a new camp.
This was a spot known to but a few, and he felt
certain that Reff Ritter would not be able to follow
them to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the horse and wagon along over the
stones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then drive them down
Baker&rsquo;s brook. Water leaves a mighty poor
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll do the best we can,&rdquo; said Bob
Grenwood, who was placed at the head of the
cadets to superintend the removal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>About half-past two the butcher and the two
farmers arrived, in company with a small, fat
man who gravely announced himself as one of
the deputy sheriffs of the county.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar! Has he come to arrest us!&rdquo;
whispered Bart Conners, as the deputy sheriff
eyed the boys in a suspicious manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he has come to arrest the chicken thieves&mdash;if
he can find them,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>It looked as if a storm might be brewing, so
no time was lost in starting in the direction of the
tramps&rsquo; camp. Andy and Stuffer, knowing the
trail, led the way, and the men from Cedarville
and Mr. Ford and six of the cadets followed. The
deputy sheriff and the two farmers carried shotguns,
and the butcher boastfully exhibited a pistol
of the old &ldquo;hoss&rdquo; variety, and nearly two feet
long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well arm ourselves,&rdquo; suggested
Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;There is no telling what may
happen, if those rascals show fight.&rdquo; And he cut
himself a stout stick, and the cadets did likewise.</p>
<p>The deputy sheriff being fat was also short of
wind, so the party had to move slowly. Once
they came to a halt, Andy and Stuffer being
a little doubtful of the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;take us off the road,&rdquo; panted the
deputy sheriff. &ldquo;This walk&mdash;er&mdash;is bad enough
as it is,&rdquo; and he gave a deep sigh. Walking had
never been his strong point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>At last they came in sight of the hollow and
Andy pointed out the rude shelter and the remains
of a campfire. Not a soul was to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they have deserted the spot,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;If they have it&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t tell me you have brought me here
on a fool&rsquo;s errand!&rdquo; puffed the deputy sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are fooled, Mr. Nugg, so are we,&rdquo; answered
Rossmore Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see somebody sleeping under that
shelter,&rdquo; said the butcher. &ldquo;Yes, I do! It&rsquo;s a
man&mdash;and a tramp, by the looks of his ragged
clothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then some of them must be on hand,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the man I am after is there,&rdquo; put in
Andy. He was thinking more of the things he
had lost than of capturing the rascals on account
of the chickens that had been stolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better surround the place?&rdquo; suggested
Jack, with true military instinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;er&mdash;what I was going to suggest,&rdquo; said
Mr. Nugg, quickly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t do any shooting
unless I give the command,&rdquo; he continued warningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if it will be necessary to do any shooting,&rdquo;
said Rossmore Ford. &ldquo;Tramps are usually
cowards and give up at the sight of firearms. If
we do any shooting somebody of our own party
may get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spread out in a circle and with caution
drew closer to the tramps&rsquo; camp. As they approached
they saw that three men were resting
under the rude shelter. Presently one of the
men raised his head, looked around and uttered a
cry of warning. Then all leaped to their feet,
gazing at the approaching men and boys in consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, in the name of the law!&rdquo; shouted
the fat deputy sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s dis anyhow?&rdquo; demanded one of the
tramps, trying to retreat, and finding himself
hemmed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you surrender, or do you want to be
shot?&rdquo; asked the butcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender?&rdquo; asked a second tramp. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
dis? We ain&rsquo;t done nuthin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with your hands!&rdquo; went on the deputy
sheriff, who was bound to make the capture as
dramatic as possible, and up into the air went
three very dirty pairs of hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more of you around here?&rdquo; asked Andy,
quickly, for he saw that not one of the fellows
present was the individual he had met at the
jewelry store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;De udders have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the third tramp,
a nervous looking young fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shut yer mouth, Bug!&rdquo; cried the first
tramp who had spoken, warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him speak if he wants to,&rdquo; said Jack,
stepping forward. At the sight of the military
uniform the rascals looked much worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So youse is bringin&rsquo; de soldiers here, hey?&rdquo;
said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da ain&rsquo;t soldiers, da are cadets from a
school,&rdquo; said one tramp. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer know Flatnose
told us about &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Flatnose?&rdquo; asked Andy eagerly. He
remembered that the tramp he was after had a
somewhat flat nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be back in about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
younger of the three tramps, when a warning
look from both of the others halted him as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he be back&mdash;answer me?&rdquo; said
Rossmore Ford sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t youse say a word more!&rdquo; growled the
largest of the tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes some men now&mdash;over yonder
hill!&rdquo; cried Dale, who chanced to look back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and there is the rascal I want to catch!&rdquo;
returned Andy. &ldquo;Come on, Jack and Pepper,
will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; answered his two chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are four men!&rdquo; cried the butcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled one of the farmers.
&ldquo;I saw him around my henhouse one evening!
He&rsquo;s the chap I want to catch!&rdquo; And
away he went with his shotgun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Wot&rsquo;s dis?&rdquo; cried one of the tramps in
the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know wot&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; answered another. &ldquo;Da
are after us! Our hangout has been discovered!
Say, boys, we have got to dust if we want to
keep out o&rsquo; jail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then off they ran, in several different directions,
and after them went Andy, Jack and
Pepper, and two other cadets, and Mr. Ford and
one of the farmers did likewise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">SOMETHING OF A CONFESSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get hold of that fellow with the
flat nose!&rdquo; cried Andy to his chums. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care so much about the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are with you, Andy,&rdquo; answered the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are bound to catch him sooner or later,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>The tramps had a start of at least a hundred
yards and lost no time in trying to escape. The
fellow called Flatnose made for a dense patch
of woods behind the spring and was soon lost to
sight. But the cadets heard him as he crashed
and plunged through brushwood and over rocks,
and slowly but steadily they drew nearer to the
rascal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well stop!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;We
are bound to catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come any closer somebody will git
hurt,&rdquo; called back the tramp roughly. &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to catch me, not much you ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;ll dare to shoot at us?&rdquo; asked
one of the cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I believe they are all
cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on plunged the tramp, with the boys
after him. He was now ascending a small hill.
Beyond, the cadets knew, was a cliff, fringed with
brushwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he knows about the cliff?&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must&mdash;since he has been in this neighborhood
so long,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But if he doesn&rsquo;t
he may take a nasty tumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is hoping to make us take the tumble,&rdquo;
came from Andy.</p>
<p>This was a trick the tramp had in mind, and
reaching the edge of the cliff, he darted to the
right and crouched down under some thick
bushes.</p>
<p>The cadets ran on at full speed until they
neared the cliff and then slowed up. They peered
over the edge of the height into the little valley
below but could see no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s around here somewhere,&rdquo; declared Jack,
and just then saw a bush that had been caught
back switch itself into place. He leaped into the
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is, fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Andy and Pepper in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under a bush. Come out of that!&rdquo; Jack
added to the fugitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; out,&rdquo; whined the tramp. He
was out of wind and crestfallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come out, we&rsquo;ll kick you out,&rdquo;
answered Andy, and then he shook his stick at
the fellow. &ldquo;Come out of that, and be quick
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp looked at the acrobatic youth and
he gave a little gasp. Evidently he recognized
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nuthin,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an
honest fellow, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly look it,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;Come, get up.&rdquo; And he, too, raised his stick as
if to hit the rascal over the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t strike me!&rdquo; was the cry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
come out! But I ain&rsquo;t done nuthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very reluctantly the tramp crawled out from
under the bushes and faced the boys. When
Andy looked at him his eyes fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know me,&rdquo; said Andy, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? I ain&rsquo;t never seen you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have. We met in the jewelry
store in Cedarville one evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me. You&rsquo;ve got the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are the fellow. And after we met
at the jewelry store you attacked me on the road,
threw me off my bicycle, and robbed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the tramp, but his manner
showed that he was much dismayed by the
accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to know is, What did you do
with the things you took from me?&rdquo; continued
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say you had the wrong man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give up the stuff or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer my question.&rdquo; And Andy raised his
stick as if to hit the fellow on the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got the stuff,&rdquo; cried the tramp in
alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me. I&mdash;I turned the stuff
over to Levi, the fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Levi, the fence?&rdquo; queried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fence, in criminals&rsquo; language, is a receiver
of stolen goods,&rdquo; explained Jack. &ldquo;Where is
this Levi?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over in Albany. He was in Cedarville when
I give him the goods. He promised me twenty
dollars, but I only got five. He ought to be
pinched,&rdquo; went on the tramp, meaning by
&ldquo;pinched&rdquo; he should be arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with us,&rdquo; said Andy, and between
them the cadets marched the tramp back to the
camp in the hollow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>At the hangout they found that four of the
tramps had been caught and made prisoners. The
others had escaped, and what became of them
nobody found out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of that fellow Levi,&rdquo; said the
deputy sheriff. &ldquo;He has been wanted for some
time. I think the Albany police are now after
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing it would be useless to conceal matters
longer, the tramp called Flatnose made a full confession,
in which he told of attacking Andy just
as had been supposed. He had found the tree
limb in the woods near the road, and had thrust
it out from the bushes just when the bicyclist was
passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got scared when you didn&rsquo;t come to your
senses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do nuthin&rsquo; but
knock you into the road an&rsquo; take the things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was enough,&rdquo; said Andy, grimly.
&ldquo;But I must say I am thankful I wasn&rsquo;t killed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;These men are all rascals,&rdquo; said Rossmore
Ford. &ldquo;They are petty thieves, and they have
terrorized the women and children for several
miles around. We&rsquo;ll see to it that they all get
what they deserve.&rdquo; And it may be added here
that every one of the tramps was sent, later on,
to jail. At the camp were found ample proofs
of how they had been robbing not only henroosts
and sheepfolds, but also houses and barns. The
butcher and the farmers were glad to see the rascals
rounded up, and the deputy sheriff was proud
of the part he had played in the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look out for your things,&rdquo; said the
deputy to Andy. &ldquo;And as soon as we get them
we&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not deemed necessary for the cadets to
help get the tramps to the Cedarville lock-up and
so, after bidding the men good-bye, the boys
started off in the direction where the new camp
of the school runaways was to be located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager Reff Ritter was mad when he found
the horse and wagon and all those things gone,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do his best to find our new camp,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll want to fight next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, I reckon we can give him all he
wants,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>The sky was much overcast and it looked as if
it might rain at any moment. This caused the
cadets to increase their speed, and soon they were
past the spot where the first camp had been located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, look there!&rdquo; cried Pepper, presently,
and pointed among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gus Coulter!&rdquo; answered another cadet
&ldquo;What is he doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;They must be looking for us already,&rdquo; exclaimed
Jack.</p>
<p>All ran up to Coulter, to learn that he was
alone&mdash;some others who had been with him having
scattered to look for the new camp of the
crowd under the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Coulter, I want to talk to you!&rdquo;
cried Jack, grabbing the cadet by the arm.
&ldquo;Come here, boys!&rdquo; he added, to his friends.</p>
<p>Thus caught alone, Coulter was much frightened
and when the young major began to talk to
him he trembled in every limb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you, Coulter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a certain talk you had with Reff Ritter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will know before I am done with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me go,&rdquo; said Coulter, uneasily. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t got any right to detain me in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am taking the right,&rdquo; answered the
young major sturdily. &ldquo;I want you to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>Jack got no further, for with a sudden twist
and a push Gus Coulter freed himself, leaped
through the crowd, and dashed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him!&rdquo; yelled Pepper. &ldquo;He mustn&rsquo;t get
away like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we can catch him,&rdquo; put in Andy, and
then all of the cadets started in pursuit of the
fleeing one.</p>
<p>Coulter was badly scared&mdash;why he could not
exactly tell&mdash;and he ran like a deer. But the
others kept on his track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes!&rdquo; cried Jack, as the running
lad darted behind a heavy clump of bushes.</p>
<p>The next instant there arose on the air a wild
cry of dismay and alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Help me, somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in trouble!&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow&mdash;or somebody else may get into
trouble, too,&rdquo; cautioned the young major.</p>
<p>Slackening their pace, the crowd approached
the clump of bushes and passed around to one
side. They then saw what had caused Coulter to
cry for assistance.</p>
<p>On the other side of the bushes was a big
swamp hole, filled with muck, dead leaves and
water. In his anxiety to escape Gus Coulter had
plunged into the swamp hole and was now up to
his waist and rapidly sinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ge&mdash;get m&mdash;me out, somebody!&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;Quick, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go down an&mdash;and be smothered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others saw that Coulter&rsquo;s plight was serious
and something must be done to save him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; cried Andy, as he looked around.
&ldquo;I reckon I can get him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acrobatic youth ran to a big tree growing
close to the edge of the swamp. He climbed up
with marvellous rapidity, and then worked his
way out on a branch that grew over Coulter&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Andy!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the limb will bend down far enough,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>Soon the acrobatic youth was close to the
outer end of the limb. He bent down, but his
hand did not come within a foot of Gus Coulter&rsquo;s
reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t ma&mdash;make it!&rdquo; gasped the boy below.
His face was full of abject fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>He turned over, and the next moment was
hanging from the limb by his feet, which he had
crossed one over the other. Thus he was able to
reach Coulter with ease.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Andy, that you don&rsquo;t go down,
too,&rdquo; cautioned Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And take care that the limb doesn&rsquo;t break,&rdquo;
added Pepper.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely Andy began to draw poor
Gus Coulter from the muck. It was a severe
strain on the acrobatic youth, and his muscles
stood out like whipcords, while his face, from
hanging down, became purple. The tree limb
bent low, until the outer leaves swept the swamp
hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; was the comment
of one of the cadets, but even as he spoke there
was a sucking sound and up came Coulter, and
the tree limb bounded several feet higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! He&rsquo;s got him!&rdquo; yelled Pepper, and
his cheer was echoed by the others.</p>
<p>Both boys in the tree were somewhat out of
breath and they did not descend at once. Finally
Andy slid down and Coulter followed.</p>
<p>The lad who had the accident presented a most
woebegone appearance. He was covered with
black muck up to his armpits, and some of the
muck was on his hands and face. Now that the
danger was over the others had all they could do
to keep from laughing at the unfortunate one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter, you can thank Andy for saving your
life,&rdquo; remarked Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t have tumbled into the hole
if you hadn&rsquo;t chased me,&rdquo; grumbled Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we wouldn&rsquo;t have chased you if you
hadn&rsquo;t tried to run away,&rdquo; came from the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no right to stop me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, I am taking the right, Coulter.
I want you to confess something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I haven&rsquo;t done anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what Reff Ritter did. I heard you
talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just this,&rdquo; answered Jack, and then
spoke about the talk he had heard between Reff
Ritter and Coulter concerning the use of the
French headache powders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I want you to tell the truth, Coulter,&rdquo;
said the young major, finally. &ldquo;Who put those
powders into my drinking water? Answer, or
I&rsquo;ll give you the biggest thrashing you ever had
in your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t hit me!&rdquo; cried the cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then answer&mdash;and tell the strict truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter. But if he learns I told on him
he&rsquo;ll hammer me to death,&rdquo; added Coulter, with
a very white face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>And then he told the particulars, just as Ritter
had given them. All of the cadets present listened
with interest. When Coulter had finished
Jack caught him by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get out!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Go back to Ritter,
and don&rsquo;t you show your face near our camp!&rdquo;
And Coulter lost no time in disappearing.</p>
<p>Five minutes later the cadets came in sight of
the new camp. As they entered the clearing Pepper
gave a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There is Captain Putnam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve
got to face the music!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">BACK TO THE HALL&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentlemen, it would seem that
you have been taking matters into your own
hands,&rdquo; remarked Captain Putnam, as he faced
those who had just arrived. He looked stern,
yet not as angry as they had sometimes seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, we felt it was absolutely
necessary to do what we have done,&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the others told you how we were
treated?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In part, yes. But I wish to hear what you
have to say also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;d like to hear what Mr.
Crabtree and Mr. Cuddle have to say,&rdquo; put in
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that just now,&rdquo; said the master
of the Hall. &ldquo;Major Ruddy, I will listen to your
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>In a plain, straightforward manner Jack told
his story from beginning to end, very much as I
have set it down here. He did not omit a single
important detail. He told of the throwing of
the inkwell, the hot potatoes and the bread, but
mentioned no names. He also related the particulars
of the trouble in the classrooms, and of
how Pluxton Cuddle had endeavored to starve
them into submission, aided in this work by
Josiah Crabtree. When this was told the captain
drew down the corners of his mouth and
frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stand for that&mdash;I knew he
wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; whispered Dale to Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would stand for starving!&rdquo; cried the
lad who loved to eat.</p>
<p>After Jack had finished, several other cadets
were interviewed. Then Captain Putnam wanted
to know the whereabouts of Ritter and his crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take you to them,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not be necessary, Blackmore. You
may go to their camp and tell them that I want
them to return to Putnam Hall at once.&rdquo; And
somewhat against his will, Dale departed on the
errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break camp and return to the school, now,&rdquo;
Captain Putnam turned to Jack. &ldquo;Major Ruddy,
you will give the necessary orders.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly, sir&mdash;now that you are back, Captain
Putnam,&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really glad that I am back, Ruddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;and I know the others are glad, too.
We didn&rsquo;t run away just for the fun of it,&rdquo; he
added, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may give my school a black eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as much of a black eye as the teachers
gave it by hiring those men from Cedarville to
come down and play guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is true&mdash;and I have already told Mr.
Crabtree so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you&rsquo;ve been to the school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The young major hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll thrash this whole thing out later,
Ruddy. It is too serious a matter to decide now.
A storm is coming and I want you to get back
if possible before it breaks. Start for the school
as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than quarter of an hour the cadets were
on the march. Andy drove the wagon, which was
piled high with the outfit. Captain Putnam
walked by the young major&rsquo;s side, and the cadets
kept step as if on dress parade. All wondered
what would be the end of the affair. Would any
of them be expelled?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>At the entrance to the campus they were met
by Peleg Snuggers, and he was directed to take
charge of the wagon and its contents. Then the
cadets entered the Hall. All was silent within,
and neither Josiah Crabtree nor Pluxton Cuddle
showed himself. The boys were told to go
straight to the general assembly room.</p>
<p>It had begun to rain and soon it was pouring
in torrents, while the lightning flashed and the
thunder roared incessantly. In the midst of the
storm Dale dashed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to their old camp, but Ritter and his
crowd had moved,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find
them, and not wishing to get soaked I came to the
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;But it
cannot be helped. I will send for them again
after the storm clears off.&rdquo; Then the captain left
the cadets in the assembly room, telling them to
keep quiet until his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he is going to have it out with Crabtree
and Cuddle,&rdquo; whispered Pepper. And he
was right.</p>
<p>An hour passed, and then a side door opened
and Captain Putnam entered, followed by Josiah
Crabtree and Frank Barringer. The boys started
on seeing the teacher for he seemed suddenly to
have grown several years older. The master of
the Hall ascended the platform and made a
speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard both sides of this controversy,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Mistakes have been made all around.
It was a mistake for you cadets to become disorderly
in the classrooms and in the mess hall&mdash;and
it was a mistake on the part of the teachers
to attempt to starve you into submission. For
trying to starve you I find Mr. Cuddle responsible,
and he has this day severed his connection
with Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; whispered Andy. &ldquo;Good-bye to Cuddle,
and may we never see his like again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree is willing to let bygones be bygones,&rdquo;
went on Captain Putnam. &ldquo;He realizes
his mistakes and regrets them. Supposing I am
willing to overlook what you have done, young
gentlemen, are you willing to start in to-morrow
morning as if nothing unusual had occurred? If
so, stand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One after another the cadets stood up until
not one remained seated. A smile spread over
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s face, and this was reflected on
the face of Josiah Crabtree. The cadets did not
know it, but their standing up saved for the
teacher his position. Had they not been willing
to forgive and forget Crabtree would have been
discharged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Captain Putnam!&rdquo; cried
Pepper, and though the master of the Hall raised
his hand to protest the cheers were given with a
will. A faint cheer followed for Crabtree and
the teacher arose and very awkwardly bowed his
acknowledgement. Then the cadets were dismissed
and the bell rang for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we won&rsquo;t see Pluxton Cuddle,&rdquo; said
Andy, and he was right, that unpopular
teacher left early the next morning, before any
of the cadets were around.</p>
<p>It was not until the next afternoon that Reff
Ritter and his crowd showed themselves, and they
brought the mail taken from the post-office.
They had heard of Captain Putnam&rsquo;s return and
had come in of their own accord. The storm
had blown down their tents and they were wet to
the skin and terribly hungry. There had been
a bitter quarrel among the crowd, and this was
kept up after they got back. One of the boys
had heard Ritter speak about the exchanging of
blank cartridges for those containing bullets at
the target practice and immediately upon his return
to Putnam Hall he sought out Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want, Akers?&rdquo; demanded
the master of the school, sternly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I have done wrong, sir,&rdquo; said Akers.
&ldquo;But, Captain Putnam, I came to speak of something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It concerns Bob Grenwood, our former quartermaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of Grenwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you remember about those blank
cartridges that were dealt out to some of us when
we had target practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to tell you positively, sir, that
Grenwood is not guilty&mdash;that he had nothing to
do with handing them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, when we were out camping, Reff
Ritter got to boasting, and he told how he and
another fellow got the blanks and distributed
them. It was done at the time of the snake scare.
There was no snake&mdash;the scare was gotten up
merely to attract our attention, so that the blanks
could be taken from the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! You are sure of this?&rdquo; demanded
Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all the particulars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Thereupon Akers told his story in detail, to
which the master of the Hall listened with close
attention. Then several other boys came in,
among them Andy and Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you about the time Major
Jack Ruddy fell from the flying rings and came
pretty close to being dangerously hurt,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;I guess you remember that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do&mdash;since he was very sick at the
time,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know just how he got sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the cause, Snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reff Ritter put some French headache powders
in his drinking water. The powders made
him dizzy, and that is how he came to fall from
the rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; And the captain&rsquo;s face
grew very stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is&mdash;and we can prove it by several
boys,&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem that Ritter is responsible for
many wrongdoings,&rdquo; mused the master of the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad egg,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;My own opinion
is that he ought to be expelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that later. Now tell me all
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy and Pepper related what they had heard,
and then several other boys were called in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>An hour later Captain Putnam sent for Reff
Ritter. The moment the bully entered the office
he knew that something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had some very bad reports about you,
Ritter,&rdquo; said the master sternly. &ldquo;I have a mind
to expel you on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Ritter. His voice shook as
he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For doing some very wicked and mean
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t done anything, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have&mdash;and it is useless for you to deny
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;what&mdash;er&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am speaking of how you took those blank
cartridges and used them, and of how you dosed
Major Ruddy with those French headache powders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Ritter, don&rsquo;t add falsehoods to your
other faults. I am positive that you are guilty.
And as I said before, I have a good mind to
expel you here and now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the bully, breaking
down. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm&mdash;it was
only done in fun, sir! I&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never do such
things again! Please don&rsquo;t expel me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have killed Ruddy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I thought the powders would make
him a little sick&mdash;so he&mdash;er&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t want to
compete with me&mdash;for I was afraid of being
beaten. And the blanks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made me take Greenwood&rsquo;s office away from
him. But he shall be restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, please, Captain Putnam, don&rsquo;t expel
me!&rdquo; groaned Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to apologize to Grenwood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Ruddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes.&rdquo; It was like pulling teeth for Ritter
to utter that last word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy&rsquo;s folks may want to prosecute you
criminally,&rdquo; continued the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I hope not.&rdquo; And now Ritter grew
deadly pale.</p>
<p>After that Captain Putnam gave the misguided
youth a stern lecture and then sent him to his
room. Then Jack was called in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll make a complaint,&rdquo; said the
young major. &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it was only
a boyish prank. But I don&rsquo;t want him to try such
a prank again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a dastardly piece of business,&rdquo; was
Captain Putnam&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Ritter often acts before he thinks,&rdquo;
went on Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you want me to give him another
chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is generous of you, Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the means of casting Ritter
out, sir. Maybe if he was expelled, he&rsquo;d go to
the bad utterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, too,&mdash;yet this school cannot afford
to suffer from the actions of such a fellow.
But I will give him one more chance,&rdquo; concluded
the master of Putnam Hall. And so the matter
rested.</p>
<p>Andy was anxious to hear from the authorities,
and one day came word that the man named
Levi had been caught. In his possession were the
medal and the ring taken from the acrobatic
youth, so Andy got back what belonged to Joe
Nelson and himself, much to his satisfaction.
Levi followed the tramps to prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am rather glad our running away is
at an end,&rdquo; said Jack, two days after the return
to Putnam Hall. &ldquo;Although I did like the camping
out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are to go camping soon, Captain Putnam
said so,&rdquo; returned Pepper. &ldquo;We are to go out
in true military style too,&rdquo; he added. How the
cadets went out, and what sports and adventures
they had, will be told in another volume of this
series, to be entitled &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Encampment;
or, The Secret of the Old Mill.&rdquo; In that
book we shall meet all our old friends again, and
likewise some of their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think running away did us any harm,&rdquo;
said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fun,&rdquo; put in Bob Grenwood, who had
been restored to his position as quartermaster of
the school battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; declared Pepper.</p>
<p>And then the drum rolled for the evening
parade and the cadets rushed off to get their guns
and swords; and here we will leave them, wishing
them well.</p>
